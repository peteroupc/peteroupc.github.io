     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, arr, zerosAtEnd=False)
     |      Binary expansion of a real number in [0, 1], initialized
     |      from an array of zeros and ones expressing the binary
     |      expansion.
     |      The first binary digit is the half digit, the second
     |      is the quarter digit, the third is the one-eighth digit,
     |      and so on.  Note that the number 1 can be
     |      expressed by passing an empty array and specifying
     |      zerosAtEnd = False, and the number 0 can be
     |      expressed by passing an empty array and specifying
     |      zerosAtEnd = True.
     |      arr - Array indicating the initial digits of the binary
     |      expansion.
     |      zerosAtEnd - Indicates whether the binary expansion
     |      is expressed as 0.xxx0000... or 0.yyy1111... (e.g., 0.1010000...
     |      vs. 0.1001111....  Default is the latter case (False).
     |
     |  entropy(self)

     |  eof(self)
     |      Returns True if the end of the binary expansion was reached; False otherwise.

     |      interval [0, 1].
     |
     |  fromFraction(f)

     |
     |  get(f)
     |      Creates a binary expansion object from a fraction, 'int', or

     |
     |  getOrReset(f)
     |      Creates a binary expansion object from a fraction, 'int', or
     |      'float' in the interval [0, 1]; resets 'f' (calls its reset method) otherwise.

    class BringmannLarsen(builtins.object)
     |  BringmannLarsen(weights)
     |
     |  Implements Bringmann and Larsen's sampler, which chooses a random variate in [0, n)
     |  where the probability that each number is chosen is weighted.  The 'weights' is the
     |  list of weights each 0 or greater; the higher the weight, the greater
     |  the probability.  This sampler supports only integer weights.
     |  This is a succinct (space-saving) data structure for this purpose.

    class ConvexPolygonSampler(builtins.object)
     |  ConvexPolygonSampler(randgen, points)
     |
     |  A class for uniform random sampling of
     |  points from a convex polygon.  This
     |  class only supports convex polygons because
     |  the random sampling process involves
     |  triangulating a polygon, which is trivial
     |  for convex polygons only. "randgen" is a RandomGen
     |  object, and "points" is a list of points
     |  (two-item lists) that make up the polygon.

    class DensityInversionSampler(builtins.object)
     |  DensityInversionSampler(pdf, bl, br, ures=1e-08)
     |
     |  A sampler that generates random samples from
     |    a continuous distribution for which
     |    only the probability density function (PDF) is known,
     |    using the inversion method.  This sampler
     |    allows quantiles for the distribution to be calculated
     |    from pregenerated uniform random variates in [0, 1].
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF. It takes a single
     |    number and outputs a single number. The area under
     |    the PDF need not equal 1 (this sampler works even if the
     |    PDF is only known up to a normalizing constant).
     |  - bl, br - Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  Both
     |     bl and br are numbers giving the domain,
     |     which in this case is [bl, br].  For best results, the
     |     probabilities outside the sampling domain should be
     |     negligible (the reference cited below uses cutoff points
     |     such that the probabilities for each tail integrate to
     |     about ures*0.05 or less).
     |  - ures - Maximum approximation error tolerable, or
     |    "u-resolution".  Default is 10^-8.  This error tolerance
     |    "does not work for continuous distributions [whose PDFs
     |    have] high and narrow peaks or poles".  This sampler's
     |    approximation error will generally be less than this tolerance,
     |    but this is not guaranteed, especially for PDFs of the kind
     |    just mentioned.

     |
     |  codegen(self, name='dist')
     |      Generates standalone Python code that samples
     |              (approximately) from the distribution estimated
     |              in this class.  Idea from Leydold, et al.,

     |              Nonuniform Random Variate Generation", 2001.
     |      - name: Distribution name.  Generates Python methods called
     |         sample_X (samples one random variate), and quantile_X
     |         (finds the quantile
     |         for a uniform random variate in [0, 1]),
     |         where X is the name given here.
     |
     |  quantile(self, v)
     |      Calculates quantiles from uniform random variates
     |            in the interval [0, 1].
     |      - v: A list of uniform random variates.
     |      Returns a list of the quantiles corresponding to the
     |      uniform random variates.  The returned list will have
     |      the same number of entries as 'v'.
     |
     |  sample(self, rg, n=1)
     |      Generates random variates that (approximately) follow the
     |            distribution modeled by this class.
     |      - n: The number of random variates to generate.

    class DensityTiling(builtins.object)
     |  DensityTiling(pdf, bl, br, cycles=8)
     |
     |  Produces a tiling of a probability density function (PDF)
     |       for the purposes of random variate generation.  The PDF is
     |       decomposed into tiles; these tiles will either cross the PDF
     |       or go below the PDF.  In each recursion cycle, each tile is
     |       split into four tiles, and tiles that end up above the PDF are
     |       discarded.
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF. It takes a single
     |    number and outputs a single number. The area under
     |    the PDF need not equal 1 (this class tolerates the PDF even if
     |    it is only known up to a normalizing constant).  For best results,
     |    the PDF should be less than or equal to a finite number  (thus, it should be free of _poles_, or points
     |    that approach infinity).  If the PDF does contain a pole, this class
     |    may accommodate the pole by sampling from a modified version of the PDF,
     |    so that points extremely close to the pole may be sampled
     |    at a higher or lower probability than otherwise (but not in a way
     |    that significantly affects the chance of sampling points
     |    outside the pole region).
     |  - bl, br - Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  Both
     |     bl and br are numbers giving the domain,
     |     which in this case is [bl, br].
     |  - cycles - Number of recursion cycles in which to split tiles
     |     that follow the PDF.  Default is 8.

     |    density at that value (which is 0 or greater).  Currently,
     |    the PDF must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

    class RandomGen(builtins.object)
     |  RandomGen(rng=None)
     |
     |  A class that implements many methods for
     |  random variate generation and sampling.  It takes
     |  an underlying RNG as specified in the constructor.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, rng=None)
     |      Initializes a new RandomGen instance.
     |      NOTES:
     |
     |      1. Assumes that 'rng' implements
     |      a 'randint(a, b)' method that returns a random
     |      integer in the interval [a, b].  Currently, this
     |      class assumes 'a' is always 0.
     |      2. 'rndint' (and functions that ultimately call it) may be
     |      slower than desirable if many random variates are
     |      needed at once.  Ways to improve the performance
     |      of generating many random variates at once include
     |      vectorization (which is often PRNG specific) and multithreading
     |      (which is too complicated to show here).
     |
     |  ball_point(self, dims, radius=1)
     |      Generates an independent and uniform random point inside a 'dims'-dimensional
     |      ball (disc, solid sphere, etc.) centered at the origin.
     |
     |  bernoulli(self, p)
     |      Returns 1 at probability p, 0 otherwise.
     |
     |  beta(self, a, b, nc=0)
     |      Generates a beta-distributed random variate.

     |  discretegen(self, probs)
     |      Generates a random integer in [0, n), where the probability
     |      of drawing each integer is specified as a list
     |      of probabilities that sum to 1, where n is the
     |      number of probabilities.  This method is optimal,
     |      or at least nearly so, in terms of the number of random
     |      bits required to generate the number
     |      on average. This method implements
     |      a solution to exercise 3.4.2 of chapter 15 of Luc Devroye's
     |      _Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation_, 1986.

     |      - probs.  List of probability objects, where for each item
     |         in the probability list, the integer 'i' is chosen
     |         with probability 'probs[i]'.
     |         Each probability object provides access to a binary
     |         expansion of the probability, which must be a real number in
     |         the interval [0, 1]. The binary expansion is a sequence of zeros and ones
     |         expressed as follows: The first binary digit is the half digit, the second
     |         is the quarter digit, the third is the one-eighth digit,
     |         and so on. Note that any probability with a terminating binary
     |         expansion (except 0) can be implemented by "subtracting" 1
     |         from the expansion and then appending an infinite sequence
     |         of ones at the end. The probability object must implement the following
     |         three methods:
     |         - reset(): Resets the probability object to the first digit in
     |            the binary expansion.
     |         - nextbit(): Gets the next digit in the binary expansion.
     |         - eof(): Gets whether the end of the binary expansion was reached
     |            (True or False), meaning the rest of the digits in the expansion are
     |            all zeros.
     |         The probability object will have to be mutable for this method
     |         to work.
     |         The BinaryExpansion class is a convenient way to express numbers
     |         as probability objects that meet these criteria.  Each probability object
     |         can also be a float, int, or Fraction in the interval [0, 1].

     |      the first is a multiple of 1/(2^X), the second is X, the third is the integer
     |      part (initially -1 to indicate the integer part wasn't sampled yet),

     |      Estimates the probability of heads of a coin.  GBAS = Gamma Bernoulli approximation scheme.
     |      The algorithm is simple to describe: "Flip a coin until it shows heads
     |         _k_ times.  The estimated probability of heads is then `(k-1)/GammaDist(r, 1)`,
     |         where _r_ is the total number of coin flips."
     |      The estimate is unbiased (the average of multiple estimates tends to the coin's probability of heads as more estimates are averaged) but has nonzero probability of being
     |      greater than 1 (that is, the estimate does not lie in [0, 1] almost surely).
     |      Assumes the probability of heads is in the interval (0, 1].
     |      [[[NOTE: As can be seen in Feng et al., the following are equivalent to the previous
     |      algorithm:
     |        Geometric: "Let G be 0. Do this _k_ times: 'Flip a coin until it shows heads, let _r_ be the number of flips (including the last), and add GammaDist(r, 1) to G.' The estimated probability
     |         of heads is then `(k-1)/G`."

     |      point in the universal dyadic decomposition for random variate generation.
     |      - point: A list of coordinates of a point in space.  This method assumes
     |        the point was a randomly generated member of a geometric set (such as a
     |        sphere, ellipse, polygon, or any other volume).  Let N be the number
     |        of coordinates of this parameter (the number of dimensions).
     |      - f: A function that determines whether a point belongs in the geometric set.
     |        Returns True if so, and False otherwise.  This method takes as input a list
     |        containing N coordinates describing a point in space.  If this parameter is
     |        given, this method assumes the geometric set is convex (and this method
     |        may return incorrect results for concave sets), because the method checks
     |        only the corners of each box to determine whether the box is entirely included
     |        in the geometric set.
     |      - fbox: A function that determines whether a box is included
     |        in the geometric set. This method takes
     |        as input a list containing N items, where each item is a list containing the
     |        lowest and highest value of the box for the corresponding dimension.  Returns 0 if the
     |        box is entirely outside the set, 1 if the box is partially inside the set (or if the
     |        method is not certain whether the box is inside or outside the set), and 2
     |        if the box is entirely inside the set.
     |      Returns a list containing two items. The first describes the size of the box
     |      (as a negative power of 2). The second is a list of coordinates describing the

     |      - point: A list of coordinates of a point in space.  This method assumes
     |        the point was random generated and within the support of a continuous
     |        distribution with a PDF.  Let N be the number of coordinates of this parameter
     |        (the number of dimensions).
     |      - pdf: The probability density function (PDF) of the continuous distribution.
     |        This method takes as input a list
     |        containing N coordinates describing a point in space, and returns the probability
     |        density of that point as a single number.  If this parameter is given, however:
     |        - This method assumes the PDF is unimodal and strictly decreasing in every direction away from the PDF's mode, and may return incorrect results if that is not the case.
     |        - If the given PDF outputs floating-point numbers, the resulting
     |          dyadic decomposition code may be inaccurate due to rounding errors.
     |      - pdfbounds: A function that returns the lower and upper bounds of the PDF's value
     |        at a box. This method takes as input a list containing N items, where each item
     |        is a list containing the lowest and highest value of the box for the
     |        corresponding dimension.  Returns a list
     |        containing two items: the lower bound and the upper bound, respectively, of the
     |        PDF anywhere in the given box.  If this parameter is
     |        given, this method assumes the PDF is continuous almost everywhere and bounded
     |        from above; the dyadic decomposition will generally work only if that is the case.
     |      - precision: Precision of random variates generated by this method, in binary digits
     |        after the point.  Default is 53.
     |      Returns a list containing two items. The first describes the size of the box
     |      (as a negative power of 2). The second is a list of coordinates describing the
     |      position.  Let v be 2**-ret[0].  The box is then calculated as (ret[1][0]*v,
     |      ret[1]*v+v), ..., (ret[1][n-1]*v, ret[1][n-1]*v+v).
     |      Raises an error if the point is determined to be outside the support of the PDF.
     |      Either pdf or pdfbounds must be passed to this method, but not both.

     |      function for discrete distributions.  The random integers
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random integers will be
     |      generated. `pdf` is the PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,

     |            - `u01` is a list of uniform random variates, in [0, 1].
     |            - `pmf` is the probability mass function (PMF)
     |            of the discrete distribution; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |            for that parameter, the probability that a random variate is
     |            equal to that parameter (each probability is in the interval [0, 1]).

     |       combination's numbers sum to 'sum' and are listed
     |       in sorted order, and each
     |       number is in the interval '[mn, mx]'.
     |        The combinations are chosen uniformly at random.
     |           'mn', 'mx', and

     |  intsInRangeWithSum(self, numSamples, numPerSample, mn, mx, sum)
     |      Generates one or more combinations of
     |       'numPerSample' numbers each, where each
     |       combination's numbers sum to 'sum' and are listed
     |       in any order, and each
     |       number is in the interval '[mn, mx]'.
     |        The combinations are chosen uniformly at random.
     |           'mn', 'mx', and

     |
     |  intsInRangesWithSum(self, numSamples, ranges, total)
     |      Generates one or more combinations of
     |       'len(ranges)' numbers each, where each
     |       combination's numbers sum to 'total', and each number
     |       has its own valid range.  'ranges' is a list of valid ranges
     |       for each number; the first item in each range is the minimum
     |       value and the second is the maximum value.  For example,
     |       'ranges' can be [[1,4],[3,5],[2,6]], which says that the first
     |       number must be in the interval [1, 4], the second in [3, 5],
     |       and the third in [2, 6].
     |        The combinations are chosen uniformly at random.
     |           Neither the integers in the 'ranges' list nor
     |       'total' may be negative.  Returns an empty
     |       list if 'numSamples' is zero.
     |        This is a modification I made to an algorithm that
     |          was contributed in a _Stack Overflow_
     |      answer (`questions/61393463`) by John McClane.
     |      Raises an error if there is no solution for the given
     |      parameters.

     |      Metropolis--Hastings.  The resulting random variates
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |      being independent.  'pdf' takes one number as
     |      a parameter and returns a number 0 or greater.

     |      Metropolis--Hastings.  The resulting random pairs
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |      being independent.  'pdf' takes one parameter,
     |      namely, a list of two numbers giving a sampled
     |      point and returns a number 0 or greater.
     |      The volume under the surface (integral) of 'pdf'

     |         An N-length array of arrays.  Each array in turn
     |         contains two items: the lower bound and upper bound
     |         for that dimension.
     |      samples - Number of times to sample the bounds of
     |         integration randomly.  The default is 1000 samples.

     |  numbers_from_cdf(self, cdf, mn, mx, n=1)
     |      Generates one or more random variates from a non-discrete probability
     |      distribution by numerically inverting its cumulative
     |      distribution function (CDF).
     |
     |      - cdf: The CDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the probability that a random variate will
     |      be less than or equal to that parameter.
     |      - mn, mx: Sampling domain.  The random variate
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].
     |      - n: How many random variates to generate. Default is 1.
     |
     |  numbers_from_dist(self, pdf, mn=0, mx=1, n=1, bitplaces=53)
     |      Generates 'n' random variates that follow a continuous
     |      distribution in an interval [mn, mx].  The distribution must have a
     |      PDF (probability density function) and the PDF must be less than or equal to a finite number and be continuous almost everywhere
     |      in the interval.  Implements section 4 of Devroye and Gravel,
     |      "The expected bit complexity of the von Neumann rejection
     |      algorithm", arXiv:1511.02273v2  [cs.IT], 2016.
     |      - 'n' is the number of random variates to generate.  Default is 1.
     |      - 'pdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: xmin, xmax, bitplaces,
     |         and returns an array of two items: the greatest lower bound of f(x) anywhere
     |         in the interval [xmin, xmax] (where f(x) is the PDF), and the least upper
     |         bound of f(x) anywhere there.  Both bounds are multiples of 2^-bitplaces.
     |      - 'bitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of bits after the
     |         binary point. The random variate will be a multiple of 2^-bitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |      - 'mn' and 'mx' express the interval.  Both are optional and
     |         are set to 0 and 1, respectively, by default.
     |
     |  numbers_from_dist_inversion(self, icdf, n=1, digitplaces=53, base=2)
     |      Generates 'n' random variates that follow a discrete or non-discrete
     |      probability distribution, using the inversion method.
     |      Implements section 5 of Devroye and Gravel,
     |      "Sampling with arbitrary precision", arXiv:1502.02539v5 [cs.IT], 2015.
     |      - 'n' is the number of random variates to generate.  Default is 1.
     |      - 'icdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: u, ubits, digitplaces,
     |         and returns a number within base^-digitplaces of the ideal inverse
     |         CDF (inverse cumulative distribution function, or quantile function)
     |         of u/base^ubits. For a given value of `digitplaces`, icdf(x)<=icdf(y)
     |         whenever 0<=x<y<=1.
     |      - 'digitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of digits after the
     |         point. Each random variate will be a multiple of base^-digitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |      - base is the digit base in which the accuracy is expressed. Default is 2
     |         (binary). (Note that 10 means decimal.)
     |
     |  numbers_from_pdf(self, pdf, mn, mx, n=1, steps=100)
     |      Generates one or more random variates from a continuous probability
     |      distribution expressed as a probability density
     |      function (PDF).  The random variate
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random variates will be
     |      generated. `pdf` is the PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, a weight indicating the relative probability
     |       that a random variate will be close to that parameter. `steps`
     |      is the number of subintervals between sample points of the PDF.
     |      The area under the curve of the PDF need not be 1.
     |      By default, `n` is 1 and `steps` is 100.
     |
     |  numbers_from_u01(self, u01, pdf, cdf, mn, mx, ures=None)
     |      Transforms one or more random variates in [0, 1] into numbers
     |      (called quantiles) that follow a non-discrete probability distribution, based on its PDF
     |      (probability density function), its CDF (cumulative distribution
     |      function), or both.
     |
     |      - u01: List of uniform random variates in [0, 1] that will be
     |      transformed into numbers that follow the distribution.
     |      - pdf: The PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the relative probability that a
     |      random variate close to that number is chosen.  The area under
     |      the PDF need not be 1 (this method works even if the PDF
     |      is only known up to a normalizing constant). Optional if a CDF is given.
     |      - cdf: [[Not used.]] The CDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the probability that a random variate will
     |      be less than or equal to that parameter. Optional if a PDF is given.
     |      For best results, the CDF should be
     |      strictly increasing everywhere in the
     |      interval [xmin, xmax].  The CDF must output values in [0, 1].
     |      - mn, mx: Sampling domain.  The random variate
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  For best results,
     |      the range given by mn and mx should cover all or
     |      almost all of the distribution.
     |      - ures - Maximum approximation error tolerable, or
     |      "u-resolution".  Default is 10^-8. The underlying sampler's approximation
     |      error will generally be less than this tolerance, but this is not guaranteed.
     |      Currently used only if a
     |      PDF is given.

     |  pareto(self, minimum, alpha)
     |

     |      a list's items (stops when 'k' items
     |      are shuffled); the shuffled items
     |      will appear at the end of the list.
     |      Returns 'list'.

     |      successful trials (sx/sy), where the probability of success in
     |      each trial is px/py.

     |      Generates 'n' random variates that follow
     |      the probability density given in 'pdf' using
     |      slice sampling.  The resulting random variates
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |        being independent.  'pdf' takes one number as

     |      a=None,
     |      c=None,
     |      acap=None
     |  )
     |      Tries to find a choice of parameters that minimizes the value
     |      of a scoring function, also called the objective function or loss
     |      function, starting from an initial guess.  This method uses an
     |      algorithm called "simultaneous perturbation
     |      stochastic approximation", which is a randomized
     |      search for the minimum value of the objective function.
     |      func - Objective function, a function that calculates a score for the
     |       given array of parameters and returns that score.  The score is a
     |       single number; the lower the score, the better.
     |       The score can be negative.  (Note that the problem of maximizing
     |       the score is the same as minimizing it except
     |       that the score's sign is reversed at the end.)
     |      guess - Initial guess for the best choice of parameters.  This is an
     |       array of parameters, each of which is a number. This array has
     |       as many items as the array passed to 'func'.
     |      iterations - Maximum number of iterations in which to run the
     |       optimization process.  Default is 200.
     |      constrain - Optional. A function that takes the given array of
     |       parameters and constrains them to fit the bounds of a valid
     |       array of parameters. This function modifies the array in place.
     |      a - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; greater than 0.
     |      c - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; greater than 0. As a guideline,
     |        'c' is about equal to the "standard deviation of the measurement noise"
     |        for several measurements at the initial guess, and is a "small positive
     |        number" if measurements are noise-free (Spall 1998).  Default
     |        is 0.001.
     |      acap - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; an
     |        integer greater than 0.

     |  surface_point(self, f, bounds, ngrad, gmax)
     |      Generates a uniform random point on
     |         a parametric surface, using a rejection
     |         approach developed by Williamson, J.F.,

    class RatioOfUniformsTiling(builtins.object)
     |  RatioOfUniformsTiling(pdf, mode=0, y0=-10, y1=10, cycles=8)
     |
     |  Produces a tiling for the purposes
     |       of fast sampling from a probability distribution via the
     |       ratio of uniforms method.
     |
     |  - pdf: The probability density function (PDF); it takes one parameter and returns,
     |     for that parameter, the relative probability that a
     |     random variate close to that number is chosen.  The area under
     |     the PDF need not be 1; this method works even if the PDF
     |     is only known up to a normalizing constant, and even if
     |     the distribution has infinitely extending tails to the left, to the right, or both.
     |     However, for the ratio of uniforms method to work, both pdf(x) and
     |     x*x*pdf(x) must be less than or equal to a finite number (thus, if the distribution has
     |     tails, they must drop off at a faster than quadratic rate).
     |  - mode: x-coordinate of the PDF's highest peak or one of them,
     |     or a location close to it.  Optional; default is 0.
     |  - y0, y1: Bounding coordinates for the ratio-of-uniforms tiling.
     |     For this class to work, y0 <= min( x*sqrt(pdf(x)) ) and
     |     y1 >= max( x*sqrt(pdf(x)) ) for every x.  Optional; the default is y0=-10, y1=10.
     |  - cycles - Number of recursion cycles in which to split tiles
     |     for the ratio-of-uniforms tiling.  Default is 8.

        Fixed

    class Fixed(builtins.object)
     |  Fixed(i)
     |
     |  Fixed-point numbers, represented using integers that store multiples
     |  of 2^-BITS.  They are not necessarily faster than floating-point numbers, nor
     |  do they necessarily have the same precision or resolution of floating-point
     |  numbers.  The main benefit of fixed-point numbers is that they improve
     |  determinism for applications that rely on non-integer real numbers (notably
     |  simulations and machine learning applications), in the sense that the operations
     |  given here deliver the same answer for the same input across computers,
     |  whereas floating-point numbers have a host of problems that make repeatable
     |  results difficult, including differences in their implementation, rounding
     |  behavior, and order of operations, as well as nonassociativity of
     |  floating-point numbers.
     |
     |  The operations given here are not guaranteed to be "constant-time"
     |  (non-data-dependent and branchless) for every relevant input.

    class DiceEnterprise(builtins.object)
     |  Implements the Dice Enterprise algorithm for
     |  turning loaded dice with unknown probability of heads into loaded dice
     |  with a different probability of heads.  Specifically, it supports specifying
     |  the probability that the output die will land on a given
     |  number, as a polynomial function of the input die's probability of heads.
     |  The case of coins to coins is also called
     |  the Bernoulli factory problem; this class allows the output
     |  coin's probability of heads to be specified as a polynomial function of the
     |  input coin's probability of heads.

     |
     |  append_poly(self, result, poly)
     |      Appends a probability that the output die will land on
     |      a given number, in the form of a polynomial.
     |      result - A number indicating the result (die roll or coin
     |        flip) that will be returned by the _output_ coin or _output_
     |        die with the probability represented by this polynomial.
     |        Must be an integer 0 or greater.  In the case of dice-to-coins
     |        or coins-to-coins, must be either 0 or 1, where 1 means
     |        heads and 0 means tails.
     |      poly - Polynomial expressed as a list of terms as follows:
     |        Each term is a list of two or more items that each express one of
     |        the polynomial's terms; the first item is the coefficient, and
     |        the remaining items are the powers of the input die's
     |        probabilities.  The number of remaining items in each term
     |        is the number of faces the _input_ die has. Specifically, the
     |        term has the following form:
     |
     |        In the case of coins-to-dice or coins-to-coins (so the probabilities are 1-p and p,
     |        where the [unknown] probability that the _input_ coin returns 0
     |        is 1 - p, or returns 1 is p):
     |                 term[0] * p**term[1] * (1-p)**term[2].
     |        In the case of dice-to-dice or dice-to-coins (so the probabilities are p1, p2, etc.,
     |        where the [unknown] probability that the _input_ die returns
     |        0 is p1, returns 1 is p2, etc.):
     |                 term[0] * p1**term[1] * p2**term[2] * ... * pn**term[n].
     |
     |        For example, [3, 4, 5] becomes:
     |                 3 * p**4 * (1-p)**5
     |        As a special case, the term can contain two items and a zero is
     |        squeezed between the first and second item.
     |        For example, [3, 4] is the same as [3, 0, 4], which in turn becomes:
     |                 3 * p**4 * (1-p)**0 = 3 * p **4
     |
     |        For best results, the coefficient should be a rational number
     |        (such as int or Python's Fraction).
     |
     |        Each term in the polynomial must have the same number of items (except
     |        for the special case given earlier).  For example, the following is not a valid
     |        way to express this parameter:
     |                 [[1, 1, 0], [1, 3, 4, 5], [1, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]
     |        Here, the second term has four items, not three like the rest.
     |      Returns this object.
     |
     |  augment(self, count=1)
     |      Augments the degree of the function represented
     |      by this object, which can improve performance in some cases
     |      (for details, see the paper).
     |      - count: Number of times to augment the ladder.
     |      Returns this object.
     |
     |  next(self, coin)
     |      Returns the next result of the flip from a coin or die
     |      that is transformed from the given input coin or die by the function
     |      represented by this Dice Enterprise object.
     |      coin - In the case of coins-to-dice or coins-to-coins (see the "append_poly" method),
     |         this specifies the _input coin_, which must be a function that
     |         returns either 1 (heads) or 0 (tails).  In the case of dice-to-dice or dice-to-coins,
     |         this specifies an _input die_ with _m_ faces, which must be a
     |         function that returns an integer in the interval [0, m), which
     |         specifies which face the input die lands on.

        MooreSampler

    class MooreSampler(builtins.object)
     |  MooreSampler(pdf, mn, mx, numLabels=1, bitAccuracy=53)
     |
     |  Moore rejection sampler, for generating independent samples
     |  from a distribution in a way that minimizes error,
     |  if the distribution has a PDF (probability density function)
     |  and the PDF uses "well-defined" arithmetic expressions.
     |  It can sample from one-dimensional or multidimensional
     |  distributions.  It can also sample from so-called "transdimensional
     |  distributions" if the distribution is the union of several component
     |  distributions that may have different dimensions and are associated
     |  with one of several _labels_.
     |
     |  Parameters:
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF.  It takes a single parameter that
     |      differs as follows, depending on the case:
     |      - One-dimensional case: A single FInterval. (An FInterval is a mathematical
     |        object that specifies upper and lower bounds of a number.)
     |      - Multidimensional case: A list of FIntervals, one for each dimension.
     |      - Transdimensional case (numLabels > 1): A list of two items: the FInterval
     |         or FIntervals, followed by a label number (an integer in [0, numLabels)).
     |      This function returns an FInterval.  For best results,
     |      the function should use interval arithmetic throughout.  The area under
     |      the PDF need not equal 1 (this sampler works even if the PDF is only known
     |      up to a normalizing constant).
     |  - mn, mx: Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  There are three cases:
     |     - One-dimensional case: Both mn and mx are numbers giving the domain,
     |        which in this case is [mn, mx].
     |     - Multidimensional case: Both mn and mx are lists giving the minimum
     |        and maximum bounds for each dimension in the sampling domain.
     |        In this case, both lists must have the same size.
     |     - Transdimensional case: Currently, this class assumes the component
     |        distributions share the same sampling domain, which
     |        is given depending on the preceding two cases.
     |     For this sampler to work, the PDF must be "locally Lipschitz" in the
     |     sampling domain, meaning that the PDF is continuous and there is a constant _L_ such that PDF(_x_) and PDF(_y_) are in the sampling domain and no more than _L_ times _&epsilon;_ apart whenever _x_ and _y_ are no more than _&epsilon;_ apart.
     |  - numlabels: The number of labels associated with the distribution, if it's a
     |     transdimensional distribution.  Optional; the default is 1.
     |  - bitAccuracy: Bit accuracy of the sampler; the sampler will sample from
     |     a distribution (truncated to the sampling domain) that is close to the
     |     ideal distribution by 2^-bitAccuracy.  The default is 53.

     |
     |  sample(self)
     |      Samples a number or vector (depending on the number of dimensions)

     |      If the sampler is transdimensional (the number of labels is greater than 1),
     |      instead returns a list containing the sample and a random label in the
     |      interval [0, numLabels), in that order.

    betadist(b, ax=1, ay=1, bx=1, by=1, precision=53)

    betadist_geobag(b, ax=1, ay=1, bx=1, by=1)
        Generates a beta-distributed random number with arbitrary
         (user-defined) precision.  Currently, this sampler only works if (ax/ay) and
         (bx/by) are both 1 or greater, or if one of these parameters is
        1 and the other is less than 1.
        - b: Bernoulli object (from the "bernoulli" module).
        - ax, ay: Numerator and denominator of first shape parameter.
        - bx, by: Numerator and denominator of second shape parameter.
        - precision: Number of bits after the point that the result will contain.

    genshape(rg, inshape)
        Generates a random point inside a 2-dimensional shape, in the form of a uniform PSRN.
        inshape is a function that takes three parameters (x, y, s) and
        returns 1 if the box (x/s,y/s,(x+1)/s,(y+1)/s) is fully in the shape;
        -1 if not; and 0 if partially.

    geobagcompare(bag, f)
        Returns 1 with probability f(U), where U is the value that
          the given geometric bag turns out to hold, or 0 otherwise.
          This method samples bits from the geometric bag as necessary.
        - b: Geometric bag, that is, an ordinary Python list
           that holds a list of bits from left to
           right starting with the bit immediately after the binary point.
           An item can contain the value None, which indicates an
           unsampled bit.
        - f: Function to run, which takes one parameter, namely a 'float'.
          Currently, this method assumes f is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
          Note that this may suffer rounding and other approximation
          errors as a result.  A more robust implementation would require
          the method to return an interval (as in interval arithmetic)
          or would pass the desired level of accuracy to the function given
          here, and would probably have the function use arbitrary-precision
          rational or floating-point numbers rather than the fixed-precision
          'float' type of Python, which usually has 53 bits of precision.
