    class Bernoulli(builtins.object)
     |  This class contains methods that generate Bernoulli random numbers,
     |     (either 1 or heads with a given probability, or 0 or tails otherwise).
     |     This class also includes implementations of so-called "Bernoulli factories", algorithms
     |  that sample a new probability given a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability.

     |      Divided by one plus p: B(p) => B(1/(1+p)), implemented
     |              as a special case of the two-coin construction.  Prefer over even-parity
     |              for having bounded expected running time for all heads probabilities.
     |      - f: Function that returns 1 if heads and 0 if tails.

     |        distributed random number.  Each element of the list is 0, 1, or None (meaning
     |        the digit is not yet known).  The list may be expanded as necessary to put

     |  sin(self, f)
     |      Sine Bernoulli factory: B(p) => B(sin(p)).  Special

     |
     |  twofacpower(self, fbase, fexponent)
     |      Bernoulli factory B(p, q) => B(p^q).
     |      Based on algorithm from (Mendo 2019),

     |         x/y must be in [0, 1]. Uses a uniformly-fast special case of
     |      the two-coin Bernoulli factory, rather than the even-parity construction in

    class DiceEnterprise(builtins.object)
     |  Implements the Dice Enterprise algorithm for
     |  turning loaded dice with unknown probability of heads into loaded dice
     |  with a different probability of heads.  Specifically, it supports specifying
     |  the probability that the output die will land on a given
     |  number, as a polynomial function of the input die's probability of heads.
     |  The case of coins to coins is also called
     |  the Bernoulli factory problem; this class allows the output
     |  coin's probability of heads to be specified as a polynomial function of the
     |  input coin's probability of heads.

     |
     |  >>> from bernoulli import DiceEnterprise
     |  >>> import math
     |  >>> import random
     |  >>>
     |  >>> ent=DiceEnterprise()
     |  >>> # Example 3 from the paper
     |  >>> ent.append_poly(1,[[math.sqrt(2),3]])
     |  >>> ent.append_poly(0,[[-5,3],[11,2],[-9,1],[3,0]])
     |  >>> coin=lambda: 1 if random.random() < 0.60 else 0
     |  >>> print([ent.next(coin) for i in range(100)])

     |
     |  append_poly(self, result, poly)
     |      Appends a probability that the output die will land on
     |      a given number, in the form of a polynomial.
     |      result - A number indicating the result (die roll or coin
     |        flip) that will be returned by the _output_ coin or _output_
     |        die with the probability represented by this polynomial.
     |        Must be an integer 0 or greater.  In the case of dice-to-coins
     |        or coins-to-coins, must be either 0 or 1, where 1 means
     |        heads and 0 means tails.
     |      poly - Polynomial expressed as a list of terms as follows:
     |        Each term is a list of two or more items that each express one of
     |        the polynomial's terms; the first item is the coefficient, and
     |        the remaining items are the powers of the input die's
     |        probabilities.  The number of remaining items in each term
     |        is the number of faces the _input_ die has. Specifically, the
     |        term has the following form:
     |
     |        In the case of coins-to-dice or coins-to-coins (so the probabilities are 1-p and p,
     |        where the [unknown] probability that the _input_ coin returns 0
     |        is 1 - p, or returns 1 is p):
     |                 term[0] * p**term[1] * (1-p)**term[2].
     |        In the case of dice-to-dice or dice-to-coins (so the probabilities are p1, p2, etc.,
     |        where the [unknown] probability that the _input_ die returns
     |        0 is p1, returns 1 is p2, etc.):
     |                 term[0] * p1**term[1] * p2**term[2] * ... * pn**term[n].
     |
     |        For example, [3, 4, 5] becomes:
     |                 3 * p**4 * (1-p)**5
     |        As a special case, the term can contain two items and a zero is
     |        squeezed between the first and second item.
     |        For example, [3, 4] is the same as [3, 0, 4], which in turn becomes:
     |                 3 * p**4 * (1-p)**0 = 3 * p **4
     |
     |        For best results, the coefficient should be a rational number
     |        (such as int or Python's Fraction).
     |
     |        Each term in the polynomial must have the same number of items (except
     |        for the special case given above).  For example, the following is not a valid
     |        way to express this parameter:
     |                 [[1, 1, 0], [1, 3, 4, 5], [1, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]
     |        Here, the second term has four items, not three like the rest.
     |      Returns this object.
     |
     |  augment(self, count=1)
     |      Augments the degree of the function represented
     |      by this object, which can improve performance in some cases
     |      (for details, see the paper).
     |      - count: Number of times to augment the ladder.
     |      Returns this object.
     |
     |  next(self, coin)
     |      Returns the next result of the flip from a coin or die
     |      that is transformed from the given input coin or die by the function
     |      represented by this Dice Enterprise object.
     |      coin - In the case of coins-to-dice or coins-to-coins (see the "append_poly" method),
     |         this specifies the _input coin_, which must be a function that
     |         returns either 1 (heads) or 0 (tails).  In the case of dice-to-dice or dice-to-coins,
     |         this specifies an _input die_ with _m_ faces, which must be a
     |         function that returns an integer in the interval [0, m), which
     |         specifies which face the input die lands on.
