### new MathUtil()</p>

<p>A collection of math functions for working
with vectors, matrices, quaternions, and other
mathematical objects of interest to three-dimensional graphics programming.</p>

<p><a id="Vectors"></a>
## Vectors
A vector is a line segment pointing in a certain <em>direction</em> in space and
having a certain <em>length</em> and an unspecified starting point.
A particular vector can instead be treated as describing a position
(by pointing to that position from an <em>origin</em> (0,0,0)), or a color.
In <code>MathUtil</code>, vectors are stored in arrays of numbers (usually
three or four numbers), and functions dealing with vectors begin
with “vec”.
If a 4-element vector describes a position or direction, the elements
are given as X, Y, Z, and W, in that order.
If a 4-element vector describes a color, the elements are given as red, green,
blue, and alpha, in that order (where each element ranges from 0-1).
If a 3D <em>direction</em> is used in a 4-element vector function (one beginning with “vec4”),
use 0 as the fourth element. If a 3D <em>position</em> (point) is used in a 4-element vector
function, the fourth element is generally 1. (If the
fourth element is anything other than 0, the vector is in <em>homogeneous
coordinates</em>, where the 3D position equals the first three elements divided
by the fourth.)
A <em>unit vector</em> is a vector with a length of 1. (A vector’s <em>length</em>, or <em>norm</em>, is the square root
of the sum of the squares of its components.) A vector can be “normalized” to
a unit vector by dividing each of its components by its length (doing so won’t change
the vector’s direction). The following functions normalize vectors and find their length: <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3normalize">MathUtil.vec3normalize</a> converts a 3-element vector to a unit vector; <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec4normalize">MathUtil.vec4normalize</a> converts a 4-element vector to a unit vector; <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3length">MathUtil.vec3length</a> finds a 3-element vector’s length; <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec4length">MathUtil.vec4length</a> finds a 4-element vector’s length. Note that due to rounding error, normalizing a vector with a <code>MathUtil</code> method might not necessarily result in a vector with a length of 1.
<a id="Matrices"></a>
## Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array that can describe a
transformation from one coordinate system to another. Transformations
that matrices can describe include translation (shifting), scaling, and rotation.
Functions dealing with matrices begin with “mat”.
A 3 × 3 or 4 × 4 matrix has 9 or 16 elements, respectively. In mathematical publications,
matrices are often notated in column-major order, in which each
element of the matrix is placed in columns as opposed to rows, as in the following example:</p>

<p><b>A Matrix Transforms Between Coordinate Systems:</b> A transformed 3D coordinate system is made up of an X, Y, and Z axis, and a center of the coordinate system. These are four 3-element vectors that describe how the three axes and the center map to the new coordinate system in relation to the old coordinate system.
The following depiction of a 4 × 4 matrix illustrates the meaning of each of its elements. To keep things
simple, this matrix’s transformation is one that keeps straight lines straight and parallel lines parallel.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a transformation matrix.</p>

Here, the first column shows an X axis vector at (1, 0, 0),
the second column shows a Y axis vector at (0, 0.5, 0.866025),
the third column shows a Z axis vector at (0, -0.866025, 0.5),
and the fourth column centers the coordinate system at (2, 3, 4).
Provided the matrix can be inverted (see the documentation for mat4invert), the three axis vectors are
_basis vectors_ of the coordinate system.
\*Why a 4 &times; 4 matrix?\*\* A matrix can describe _linear transformations_ from one vector in space
to another. These transformations, which include [\*\*scaling\*\*](#Scaling),
[\*\*rotation\*\*](#Rotation), and shearing, can change where a vector points _at_,
but not where it points _from_. It's enough to use a 3 &times; 3 matrix to describe
linear transformations in 3D space.
But certain other transformations, such as [\*\*translation\*\*](#Translation) and
[\*\*perspective\*\*](#Projective_Transformations), are common in 3D computer graphics.
To describe translation and perspective in 3D, the 3 &times; 3 matrix must be
augmented by an additional row and column, turning it into a 4 &times; 4 matrix.
A 4 &times; 4 matrix can describe linear transformations in 4D space and
transform 4-element vectors. A 4-element vector has four components:
X, Y, Z, and W. If a 4-element vector represents a 3D point, these
components are the point's _homogeneous coordinates_ (unless the
vector's W is 0). To convert these coordinates back to 3D, divide
X, Y, and Z by W. This is usually only required, however, if the
matrix describes a perspective projection (see
[\*\*"Projective Transformations"\*\*](#Projective_Transformations)).
A similar situation applies in 2D between 2 &times; 2 and 3 &times; 3 matrices as it does
in 3D between 3 &times; 3 and 4 &times; 4 matrices.
\*Transforming points.\*\* The transformation formula multiplies a matrix by a 3D point to change that point's
position:
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> = matrix[0] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + matrix[4] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + matrix[8] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + matrix[12] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_w_</sub>
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> = matrix[1] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + matrix[5] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + matrix[9] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + matrix[13] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_w_</sub>
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> = matrix[2] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + matrix[6] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + matrix[10] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + matrix[14] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_w_</sub>
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = matrix[3] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + matrix[7] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + matrix[11] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + matrix[15] &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_w_</sub>
For more on why \*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> appears here, see \*\*"Why a 4 &times; 4 Matrix?"\*\*, earlier. In each formula that follows, \*\*a\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> is assumed to be 1 (indicating a conventional 3D point).
\* Scaling.\*\* Scaling changes an object's size.
To create a scaling matrix, use <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4scaled">MathUtil.mat4scaled()</a>,
and specify the scaling factors for the X, Y, and Z axis. Each point is multiplied by the scaling
factors to change the object's size. For example, a Y-factor of 2 doubles an object's height.
To multiply an existing matrix by a scaling, use
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4scale">MathUtil.mat4scale()</a>. This will put the scaling
before the other transformations.
Scaling uses the 1st, 6th, and 11th elements of the matrix as seen here:
<math>
<mfenced open="[" close="]">
<mtable>
<mtr>
<mtd><mi>sx</mi></mtd>
<mtd><mn>0</mn></mtd>
<mtd><mn>0</mn></mtd>
<mtd><mn>0</mn></mtd>

</mtr>
</mtable>
</mfenced>
</math>
where the X coordinate is multiplied by `sx`, the Y coordinate is multiplied by `sy`, and
the Z coordinate is multiplied by `sz`.
The scaling formula would look like:
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> = sx &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + sy &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + sz &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 1 = 1
For example, we multiply the input x by `sx` to get the output x. If `sx` is 1, x
remains unchanged. Likewise for y (`sy`) and z (`sz`).
If `sx`, `sy`, or `sz` is -1, that coordinate is _reflected_ along the corresponding axis.
If `sx`, `sy`, and `sz` are all 1, we have an _identity matrix_, where the input vector
is equal to the output vector.
When the transformed X, Y, or Z axis has a length other than 1, the coordinate
system will be scaled up or down along that axis. The scalings given
here will scale the lengths of the corresponding axes. For example,
if `sx` is 2, the X axis will be (2, 0, 0) and thus have a length of 2.
\*\*Translation.\*\* A translation is a shifting of an object's position.
To create a translation matrix, use <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4translated">MathUtil.mat4translated()</a>,
and specify the X-offset, the Y-offset, and the Z-offset. For example, an X-offset of 1 moves
an object 1 unit to the right, and a Y offset of -1 moves it 1 unit down.
To multiply an existing matrix by a translation, use
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4translate">MathUtil.mat4translate()</a>. This will put the translation
before the other transformations. In a transformation matrix,
translation effectively occurs after all other transformations such as scaling and rotation.
It uses the 13th, 14th, and 15th elements of the matrix as seen here:

where `tx` is added to the X coordinate, `ty` is added to the Y coordinate, and
`tz` is added to the Z coordinate. The transformation formulas would look like:
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> = 1 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + tx
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 1 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + ty
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 1 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + tz
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 1 = 1
For example, we add the input x and `tx` to get the output x. If `tx` is 0, x
remains unchanged. Likewise for y (`ty`) and z (`tz`).
\*Rotation.\*\* Rotation changes an object's orientation.
To create a rotation matrix, use <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4rotated">MathUtil.mat4rotated()</a>,
and specify the angle (in degrees) to rotate, and the [\*\*axis of rotation\*\*](#Axis_of_Rotation). For example:
Specifying `(45, [1, 0, 0])` means a 45-degree rotation of the point around the X axis.
Specifying `(80, [0, 2, 3])` means a 45-degree rotation of the point around the axis that
starts at the origin (0, 0, 0) and points toward the point (0, 2, 3).
When describing an axis of rotation, <code>[1, 0, 0]</code> is the X axis,
<code>[0, 1, 0]</code> is the Y axis, and <code>[0, 0, 1]</code> is the Z axis.
To multiply an existing matrix by a rotation, use
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4rotate">MathUtil.mat4rotate()</a>. This will put the rotation
before the other transformations.
Given an angle of rotation, &theta;,
the transformation matrix for rotating 3D points is as follows. (For a list of common
sines and cosines, see the end of this section.)

<figcaption>Rotation about the Z axis.</figcaption></figure>
Note that:
When we rotate a point about the X axis, the X coordinate is unchanged
and the Y and Z coordinates are adjusted in the rotation. For rotations about the
Y axis or the Z axis, the Y or Z coordinate, respectively, is likewise unchanged.
If the axis of rotation points backward from the "eye", positive rotations mean
counterclockwise rotation in right-handed coordinate systems. For example,
60 degrees about the axis means
60 degrees counterclockwise, and negative 60 degrees means 60 degrees
clockwise.
Rotating a point around an arbitrary axis of rotation is more complicated to describe.
When describing an axis of rotation, <code>[1, 0, 0]</code> is the X axis,
<code>[0, 1, 0]</code> is the Y axis, and <code>[0, 0, 1]</code> is the Z axis.
See [\*\*"Rotation example"\*\*](#Rotation_Example) for an illustration of a rotation
transformation.

### Matrix Multiplication
The order in which you do transforms is important. In general, scaling then translating is
not the same as translating then scaling. Assuming your geometry is centered at the origin
(0, 0, 0), you should create a transformation in this order:
Call <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4identity">`MathUtil.mat4identity()`</a>, creating a matrix without a transformation.
Do your translations if needed, using <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4translate">`mat4translate()`</a>.
Do your rotations if needed, using <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4rotate">`mat4rotate()`</a>.
Do your scalings if needed, using <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4scale">`mat4scale()`</a>.
This way, the scalings and rotations will affect the object while it's still centered, and
before the translations (shifts) take place.
You can also multiply transforms using <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4multiply">MathUtil.mat4multiply()</a>.
This takes two matrices and returns one combined matrix. The combined matrix will have the effect
of doing the second matrix's transform, then the first matrix's transform.
When two matrices are multiplied, the combined matrix will be such
that the transformations they describe happen in reverse
order. For example, if the first matrix (input matrix) describes a translation and the second
matrix describes a scaling, the multiplied matrix will
describe the effect of scaling then translation.
Matrix multiplication is not commutative; the order of multiplying matrices is important.
To get an insight of how matrix multiplication works, treat the second matrix as a group
of column vectors (with the same number of rows as the number of columns in the
first matrix). Multiplying the two matrices transforms these vectors to new ones in the
same way as if the column vectors were transformed individually. (This also explains why there can
be one or more column vectors in the second matrix and not just four in the case of a 4 &times; 4 matrix,
and also why transforming a 4-element column vector is the same as multiplying a 4 &times; 4 matrix by a
matrix with one column and four rows.\*)
This insight reveals a practical use of matrix multiplication: transforming four 4-element
vectors at once using a single matrix operation involving two 4 &times; 4 matrices. After the
matrix multiplication, each of the transformed vectors will be contained in one of the four columns
of the output matrix.
The methods `mat4multiply`, `mat4scale`, `mat4scaleInPlace`, `mat4translate`, and
mat4rotate involve multiplying 4 &times; 4 matrices.

\\* Reading the [\*\*tutorial by Dmitry Sokolov\*\*](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-4:-Perspective-projection)
led me to this highly useful insight.
\*Projective transformations.\*\* In all the transformations described above, the last row in the transformation matrix is
(0, 0, 0, 1). (Such transformations are called _affine transformations_, those that
keep straight lines straight and parallel lines parallel.) However, this is not the case for
some transformations in the `MathUtil` class.
Transformations that don't necessarily preserve parallelism of lines are called _projective transformations_.
An NxN matrix can describe certain projective transformations if it has one more row and one more column
than the number of dimensions. For example, a 4 &times; 4 matrix can describe 3D projective transformations
in the form of linear transformations on homogeneous coordinates (see
[\*\*"Why a 4 &times; 4 Matrix?"\*\*](#Why_a_4x4_Matrix)). For a 3D projective transformation, the last row
in the matrix is not necessarily (0, 0, 0, 1).
One example of a projective transformation is found in a _perspective projection_ matrix,
as returned by <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4perspective">MathUtil.mat4perspective</a> or <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4frustum">MathUtil.mat4frustum</a>. When a 4-element vector is transformed with this matrix, its W component is generated by setting it to the negative Z coordinate in _eye space_, or more specifically, as follows:
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + -1 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0

## Rotation Example
As an example, say we rotate 60 degrees about the X axis (`mat4rotated(60, 1, 0, 0)`,
&theta; = 60&deg;). First, we find the rotation formula for the X axis:
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> = 1 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + (cos &theta;) &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + -(sin &theta;) &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + (sin &theta;) &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + (cos &theta;) &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 1 = 1
We calculate <i>cos &theta;</i> as 0.5 and <i>sin &theta;</i> as about 0.866025.
We plug those numbers into the rotation formula to get a formula for rotating a
point 60 degrees about the X axis.
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> = 1 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0 = \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub>
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> ~= 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0.5 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + -0.866025 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> ~= 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0.866025 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0.5 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 0
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> + 0 &#x22c5; \*\*a\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> + 1 = 1
If a point is located at (10, 20, 30), the rotated point would now be:
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_x_</sub> = 1 &#x22c5; 10 + 0 &#x22c5; 20 + 0 &#x22c5; 30 + 0
= 1 &#x22c5; 10
= 10
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_y_</sub> ~= 0 &#x22c5; 10 + 0.5 &#x22c5; 20 + -0.866025 &#x22c5; 30 + 0
~= 0.5 &#x22c5; 20 + -0.866025 &#x22c5; 30
~= 10 + -25.98075
~= -15.98075
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_z_</sub> ~= 0 &#x22c5; 10 + 0.866025 &#x22c5; 20 + 0.5 &#x22c5; 30 + 0
~= 0.866025 &#x22c5; 20 + 0.5 &#x22c5; 30
~= 17.3205 + 15
~= 32.3205
\*\*a&prime;\*\*<sub>_w_</sub> = 0 &#x22c5; 10 + 0 &#x22c5; 20 + 0 &#x22c5; 30 + 1
= 1
So the rotated point would be at about (10, -15.98075, 32.3205).
## Describing Rotations
Rotations in 3D space can be described in many ways, including
quaternions, Tait-Bryan angles, and an angle and axis.
<a id="Axis_of_Rotation"></a>
### Axis of Rotation
A rotation of vectors or points can be described using an _angle_
and an _axis of rotation_, for example, in the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4rotate">MathUtil.mat4rotate</a> method.
An axis of rotation is a vector pointing in a certain direction. When a point (or vector)
is rotated at any angle around this axis, the new point (or vector) will lie
on the same plane as the previous point. The axis of rotation describes
a vector that is perpendicular to that plane's surface (the plane's _normal_).
Here are examples of an axis of rotation.
The X axis of rotation (upward or downward turn) is (1, 0, 0).
The Y axis of rotation (leftward or rightward turn) is (0, 1, 0).
The Z axis of rotation (side-by-side sway) is (0, 0, 1).
While the axis of rotation points backward from the "eye", if the angle's value
is positive and the [\*\*coordinate system\*\*](#Coordinate_Systems) is...
...right handed, then the angle runs counterclockwise.
...left handed, then the angle runs clockwise.
While the axis of rotation points backward from the "eye", if the angle's value
is negative, then the angle runs in the opposite direction.
Vectors that point in the same direction (for example, vectors (1, 0, 0) and (2, 0, 0))
describe the same axis of rotation.
Unless stated otherwise, an axis of rotation passed to a `MathUtil`
method need not be a [\*\*unit vector\*\*](#Unit_Vectors).
### Quaternions
A quaternion is a 4-element vector that can describe a 3D rotation. Functions dealing with quaternions begin with "quat". Functions that generate quaternions include: <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatIdentity">MathUtil.quatIdentity</a>, which generates a quaternion describing an
absence of rotations; <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatFromVectors">MathUtil.quatFromVectors</a>, which generates a quaternion describing
a rotation from one vector to another; <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatFromMat4">MathUtil.quatFromMat4</a>, which generates a quaternion from a [\*\*4 &times; 4 matrix\*\*](#Matrices); <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatFromAxisAngle">MathUtil.quatFromAxisAngle</a>, which generates a quaternion from an angle and [\*\*axis of rotation\*\*](#Axis_of_Rotation); MathUtil.quatFromTaitBryan, which generates a quaternion from Tait-Bryan angles.
<a id="Using_Quaternions"></a>
#### Using Quaternions
For best results when using quaternions:
- Store the rotation of each object as a single quaternion.
- As rotations occur each frame, convert the rotation (which may be
in pitch/yaw/roll or another form, depending on the input device) to a quaternion
(see [\*\*"Generating Quaternions"\*\*](#Generating_Quaternions)
and <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatMultiply">multiply</a> that quaternion by the current
quaternion to get the object's new rotation.
- Normalize the rotation quaternion (using <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatNormalize">`quatNormalize()`</a>
or <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace">`quatNormalizeInPlace()`</a>)
every few frames. (Quaternions that describe a 3D rotation should be [\*\*unit vectors\*\*](#Unit_Vectors).)
<a id="Multiplying_Quaternions"></a>
#### Multiplying Quaternions
When two quaternions are multiplied (for example, with {@MathUtil.quatMultiply}),
the result is a combined rotation in which the second rotation happens
before the first rotation (when applied in the global coordinate frame).
Like matrix multiplication, the order in which you multiply quaternions is important.
<a id="Tait_Bryan_angles"></a>
### Tait-Bryan angles
Pitch-yaw-roll angles (also called Tait-Bryan angles) describe three different rotations
of the same vector around three different axes, called the pitch, yaw, and roll axes
(or the X, Y, Z axes, respectively), which occur one after the other. However:
There are multiple conventions for pitch-yaw-roll angles, including the order of
rotations (for example: pitch-roll-yaw, roll-pitch-yaw), and whether the rotations occur
around the object's original axes ("extrinsic") or its new axes ("intrinsic").
Rotations are multiplied like in quaternions and matrices, so the order the rotations
occur is important. For example, a 30-degree pitch followed by a 20-degree
roll is not the same as a 20-degree pitch followed by a 30-degree roll.
Pitch-yaw-roll angles can cause a problem called "gimbal lock", in which a rotation along
one axis (say, a pitch) can cause a vector to be parallel to another axis (say, the roll
axis), so that a rotation along that axis will do nothing.

&lt;a id=4 &times; 4_Matrices&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### 4 &times; 4 Matrices
A 4 &times; 4 matrix can describe a 3D vector rotation; see [\*\*"Rotation", earlier\*\*](#Rotation).
<a id="Planes"></a>
## Planes
A 4-element array can describe a plane in the following manner:
The 4 elements, labeled A, B, C, and D in that order, describe a plane
whose points satisfy the equation&mdash;
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
where x, y, and z are the
coordinates of any point lying on the plane.
A, B, and C are
the X, Y, and Z components of the plane's normal vector.
D is the signed distance from the plane to the origin (0,0,0).
It's positive if the plane's normal points toward the origin, and
negative if it points away from the origin.
D is the negative dot product of the
plane's normal and any point on the plane.
There is one method that deals with planes:
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.planeNormalizeInPlace">MathUtil.planeNormalizeInPlace</a> - Converts the plane to a form in which
its normal has a length of 1.
<a id="Boxes"></a>
## Boxes
An array of six numbers can describe an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB).
If it does, the first three numbers are the box's minimum X, Y, and Z coordinates,
and the last three numbers are the box's maximum X, Y, and Z coordinates.
If a minimum coordinate is greater than a maximum coordinate, then the
box is considered empty.
Methods that deal with boxes include:
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.boxCenter">MathUtil.boxCenter</a> - Finds a box's center.
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.boxDimensions">MathUtil.boxDimensions</a> - Finds a box's dimensions.
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.boxIsEmpty">MathUtil.boxIsEmpty</a> - Determines whether a box is empty.
<a id="Coordinate_Systems"></a>
## Coordinate Systems
There are two conventions of 3D coordinate systems, left-handed and
right-handed:
In a _left-handed_ coordinate system, the positive Z axis points _forward from the "eye"_ whenever the positive X axis points to the right and the positive Y axis points up.
In a _right-handed_ coordinate system, the positive Z axis points _backward from the "eye"_ whenever the positive X axis points to the right and the positive Y axis points up.
To show this more visually, point one hand's thumb to your right and
its index finger up, and bend the other three fingers halfway down. In a
coordinate system named after that hand (left-handed or
right-handed), if the positive X axis points in the thumb's
direction and the positive Y axis points in the index finger's direction, the Z axis will
point in the direction the other three fingers point.
As used here, the Z axis is the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3cross">cross product</a>
of two perpendicular axes, namely the X axis and the Y axis, in that order.
Which of the X, Y, or Z axes is the right, up, or forward axis is
arbitrary; for example, some conventions may have the Z axis, rather than Y,
be the up axis. Therefore, these three axes are defined here to avoid
confusion.
<a id="Differences_in_Behavior"></a>
### Differences in Behavior
<a id="Projection_and_view_matrices"></a>
#### Projection and view matrices
The difference between a left-handed and right-handed coordinate system
affects how 3D points are transformed, mainly in the projection and view
matrices. The projection and view matrices returned by Math
matrix methods are designed for a right-handed coordinate system. Their
documentation describes how to adjust them for a left-handed coordinate system.
<a id="Rotation_angles_such_as_used_in_mat4rotate_and_quatRotate"></a>
#### Rotation angles (such as used in `mat4rotate` and `quatRotate`)
While the [\*\*axis of rotation\*\*](#Axis_of_Rotation) points backward from the "eye", if the angle's value
is positive and the [\*\*coordinate system\*\*](#Coordinate_Systems) is...
...right handed, then the angle runs counterclockwise.
...left handed, then the angle runs clockwise.
While the axis of rotation points backward from the "eye", if the angle's value
is negative, then the angle runs in the opposite direction.
<a id="Cross_product_vec3cross_and_normals"></a>
#### Cross product (`vec3cross`) and normals
Given a triangle formed by...
- points (A minus C), (B minus C), and C, in that order, or
- points A, B, and (0, 0, 0), in that order,
the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3cross">cross product</a> of the first point with the second,
in that order, is a _normal_ of that triangle (a vector that's perpendicular to the triangle's surface).
While this particular normal points backward from the "eye", the triangle's vertices
run in a counterclockwise path for right-handed coordinate systems, or a clockwise path
for left-handed systems. (In general, there are two possible choices for normals, which each
point in opposite directions.)
<a id="Winding_and_face_classification"></a>
### Winding and face classification
A two-dimensional triangle has counterclockwise _winding_ if its vertices are ordered in a counterclockwise path from the first to second to third to first vertex. Otherwise, it has clockwise winding. If the triangle is in 3D space, it's first transformed into 2D _window coordinates_ before its winding is found. (Window coordinates roughly correspond to screen pixels.)
By default, in the WebGL pipeline, triangles with counterclockwise winding are _front faces_, and
other triangles are _back faces_.
<a id="Finding_a_triangle_s_winding"></a>
#### Finding a triangle's winding
To find a triangle's winding, do the following calculation (X1, X2, X3 and Y1, Y2, Y3 are the window coordinates of its vertices). Note that half of the result will be the triangle's signed area.
(X3 - X1) \* (Y3 - Y2) - (X3 - X2) \* (Y3 - Y1)
If the result is positive, and the window space X axis points right and the positive Y axis points...
...up (which is the case in WebGL), then the triangle
has counterclockwise winding.
...down, then the triangle has clockwise winding.
If the result is negative, then the triangle has the opposite winding.

each vector in <code>mat</code> by the corresponding component in
<code>v</code>, and adding up the resulting vectors (except <code>v</code>) to
get the transformed vector.

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 3 &times; 3 matrix.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt; | number)<br />X coordinate. If "vy", and "vz" are omitted, this value can instead be a 4-element array giving the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
* `vy` (Type: number) (optional)<br />Y coordinate.
* `vz` (Type: number) (optional)<br />Z coordinate. To transform a 2D point, set Z to 1, and divide the result's X and Y by the result's Z.

#### Return Value

The transformed vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat3transpose"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat3transpose(m3)

The resulting 3 &times; 3 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat3transposeInPlace"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat3transposeInPlace(mat)

Transposes a 3 &times; 3 matrix in place without creating

<a name="MathUtil.mat4frustum"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4frustum(l, r, b, t, near, far)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing a <a href="tutorial-camera.html">perspective projection</a>
in the form of a view frustum, or the limits in the "eye"'s view.

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, transformed coordinates in the view volume will have the following meanings:<ul>
<li>X coordinates range from -W to W (where W is the fourth component of the transformed vertex) and increase from "l" to "r".</li>
<li>Y coordinates range from -W to W and increase from "b" to "t" (or from "t" to "b" by default in Vulkan).</li>
<li>Z coordinates range from -W to W and increase from "near" to "far". (For view volume Z coordinates ranging from 0 to W, to accommodate how DirectX, Metal, and Vulkan handle such coordinates by default, divide the 15th element of the result, or zero-based index 14, by 2.)</li></ul>
The transformed coordinates have the meanings given above assuming that the eye space (untransformed) X, Y, and Z coordinates increase rightward, upward, and from the "eye" backward, respectively (so that the eye space is a glmath). To adjust this method's result for the opposite "hand", reverse the sign of the result's:<ul>
<li>1st to 4th elements (zero-based indices 0 to 3), to reverse the direction in which X coordinates increase, or
<li>5th to 8th elements (zero-based indices 4 to 7), to reverse the direction in which Y coordinates increase (e.g., to make those coordinates increase upward in Vulkan rather than downward), or
<li>9th to 12th elements (zero-based indices 8 to 11), to reverse the direction in which Z coordinates increase.&lt;/ul&gt;

#### Parameters

* `l` (Type: number)<br />X coordinate of the point in eye space where the left clipping plane meets the near clipping plane.
* `r` (Type: number)<br />X coordinate of the point in eye space where the right clipping plane meets the near clipping plane. ("l" is usually less than "r", so that X coordinates increase from left to right when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "l" is greater than "r", X coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `b` (Type: number)<br />Y coordinate of the point in eye space where the bottom clipping plane meets the near clipping plane.
* `t` (Type: number)<br />Y coordinate of the point in eye space where the top clipping plane meets the near clipping plane. ("b" is usually less than "t", so that, in WebGL and OpenGL by default, Y coordinates increase upward when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "b" is greater than "t", Y coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `near` (Type: number)<br />The distance, in eye space, from the "eye" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.<br />This value should be greater than 0, and should be set to the highest distance from the "eye" that the application can afford to clip out for being too close, for example, 0.5, 1, or higher.
* `far` (Type: number)<br />The distance, in eye space, from the "eye" to the far clipping plane. Objects farther than this distance won't be seen.<br />This value should be greater than 0 and should be set so that the absolute ratio of "far" to "near" is as small as the application can accept. ("near" is usually less than "far", so that, in WebGL and most other graphics pipelines by default, Z coordinates increase from the "eye" backward when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "near" is greater than "far", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<br /> In the usual case that "far" is greater than "near", depth buffer values will be more concentrated around the near plane than around the far plane due to the perspective projection. The greater the ratio of "far" to "near", the more concentrated the values will be around the near plane, and the more likely two objects close to the far plane will have identical depth values. (Most WebGL implementations support 24-bit depth buffers, meaning they support 16,777,216 possible values per pixel.)

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4identity"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4identity()

Returns the identity 4 &times; 4 matrix (a matrix that keeps
vectors unchanged when they are transformed with this matrix).

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4inverseTranspose3"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4inverseTranspose3(m4)

Returns the transposed result of the inverted 3 &times; 3 upper-left corner of
the given 4 &times; 4 matrix.

This is usually used to convert a model-view matrix (view matrix multiplied by model or world matrix) to a matrix
for transforming surface normals in order to keep them perpendicular
to a surface transformed by the model-view matrix. Normals are then
transformed by this matrix and then converted to unit vectors. But if the
input matrix uses only rotations, translations, and/or uniform scaling
(same scaling in X, Y, and Z), the 3 &times; 3 upper left of the input matrix can
be used instead of the inverse-transpose matrix to transform the normals.

#### Parameters

* `m4` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4 &times; 4 matrix.

#### Return Value

The resulting 3 &times; 3 matrix. If the matrix
can't be inverted, returns the identity 3 &times; 3 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4invert"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4invert(m)

Finds the inverse of a 4 &times; 4 matrix.
An inverted matrix can describe a transformation in three-dimensional space that undoes another transformation. For
example, if a scaling enlarges an object, the inverted matrix reduces the object to its original
size.
To invert a \*\*translation\*\*, reverse the sign of the translation elements (given above as `tx`, `ty`, and `tz`)
and generate a new translation matrix with the new translation elements. For example,
to invert the translation (5, 2, -3), use the translation (-5, -2, 3).
To invert a \*\*scaling\*\*, use 1 divided by each of the scaling elements (given above as `sx`, `sy`, and `sz`)
and generate a new scaling matrix with those elements.
For example, to invert the scaling (2, 3, 4), use the scaling (1/2, 1/3, 1/4).
To invert a \*\*rotation\*\* for a 4 &times; 4 matrix, swap the 2nd and 5th elements of the matrix,
the 3rd and 9th elements, and the 7th and 10th elements of the matrix (zero-based
elements 1, 4, 2, 8, 6, and 9 respectively). The effect is like reversing the angle of the
rotation to reset an object to its previous orientation. In general, to invert an NxN
rotation matrix, _transpose_ that matrix (so that its rows become its columns and vice versa).
\*Inverting a general NxN matrix.\*\* Matrices that use some combination of translation, scaling, and rotation as well as other kinds of matrices are more complicated to invert. In fact, some matrices can't be inverted at all. Many 4 &times; 4 or 3 &times; 3 matrices can be inverted using the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4invert">MathUtil.mat4invert()</a> or <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat3invert">MathUtil.mat3invert()</a> methods, respectively.
To describe how inverting a matrix works, we will need to define some terms:
A matrix cell's _row index_ and _column index_ tell where that cell appears in the matrix. For example, a cell on the first row has row index 0 and a cell on the second column has column index 1.
A matrix's _determinant_ is its overall
scaling factor. Only an NxN matrix with a determinant other
than 0 can be inverted. To find a matrix's determinant:
1. For each cell in the first row (or first column), find the matrix's _minor_ at that cell (that is, the determinant of a matrix generated by eliminating the row and column where that cell appears in the original matrix).
2. Label the minors (A, B, C, D, ...), in that order.
3. The matrix's determinant is (A - B + C - D + ...).
A 1 &times; 1 matrix's determinant is simply the value of its only cell.
To invert an NxN matrix:
1. Create a new NxN matrix.
2. For each cell in the original matrix, find its minor at that cell (that is, the determinant of a matrix generated by eliminating the row and column where that cell appears in the original matrix), and set the corresponding cell
in the new matrix to that value.
3. In the new matrix, reverse the sign of each cell whose row index
plus column index is odd. (These cells will alternate in a checkerboard
pattern in the matrix.)
4. Transpose the new matrix (convert its rows to columns
and vice versa).
5. Find the original matrix's determinant and divide each
cell in the new matrix by that value.
6. The new matrix will be the inverted form of the original NxN matrix.

#### Parameters

* `m` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4 &times; 4 matrix.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix.
Returns the identity matrix if this matrix's determinant, or overall scaling factor, is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4isIdentity"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4isIdentity(mat)

Returns whether a 4 &times; 4 matrix is the identity matrix.

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4 &times; 4 matrix.

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: boolean)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4lookat"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPos, [lookingAt], [up])

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix that represents a "camera" view,
transforming world space coordinates, shared by every object in a scene, to coordinates in <i>eye space</i>
(also called <i>camera space</i> or <i>view space</i>). This essentially rotates a "camera"
and moves it to somewhere in the scene. In eye space, when just this matrix is used to transform vertices:<ul>
<li>The "camera" is located at the origin (0,0,0), or
at <code>cameraPos</code> in world space,
and points forward to the <code>lookingAt</code>
position in world space. This generally
puts <code>lookingAt</code> at the center of the view.
<li>The X axis points rightward from the "camera"'s viewpoint.
<li>The Y axis points upward from the center of the "camera" to its top. The
<code>up</code> vector guides this direction.
<li>The Z axis points away from the <code>lookingAt</code> point toward the "camera", so that the eye space is a glmath.&lt;/ul&gt;

To adjust the result of this method for a left-handed coordinate system (so that the Z axis points in the opposite direction), reverse the sign of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th elements of the result (zero-based indices 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14).

#### Parameters

* `cameraPos` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 3-element vector specifying the "camera" position in world space.<br /> When used in conjunction with an <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">orthographic projection</a>, set this parameter to the value of <code>lookingAt</code> plus a glmath (for example, using <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3add">MathUtil.vec3add</a>) to form an <i>axonometric projection</i> (if the unit vector is <code>[sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3)]</code>, the result is an <i>isometric projection</i>). See the examples below.
* `lookingAt` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;) (optional)<br />A 3-element vector specifying the point in world space that the "camera" is looking at. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is the coordinates (0,0,0).
* `up` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;) (optional)<br />A 3-element vector specifying the direction from the center of the "camera" to its top. This parameter may be null or omitted, in which case the default is the vector (0, 1, 0), the vector that results when the "camera" is held upright.<br /> This vector must not be parallel to the view direction (the direction from "cameraPos" to "lookingAt"). (See the example for one way to ensure this.)<br />

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

#### Examples

The following example calls this method with an
up vector of (0, 1, 0) except if the view direction is parallel to that
vector or nearly so.

    var upVector=[0,1,0]; // Y axis
    var viewdir=MathUtil.vec3sub(lookingAt, cameraPos);
    var par=MathUtil.vec3length(MathUtil.vec3cross(viewdir,upVector));
    if(par&lt;0.00001)upVector=[0,0,1]; // view is almost parallel, so use Z axis
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPos,lookingAt,upVector);

The following example creates an
isometric projection for a right-handed coordinate system. The Y
axis will point up, the Z axis toward the lower left, and the X axis toward
the lower right.

    // Assumes an orthographic projection matrix is used. Example:
    // var projectionMatrix=MathUtil.mat4ortho(-10,10,-10,10,-50,50);
    // "Camera" will be at (1,1,1) -- actually (sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3),sqrt(1/3)) --
    // and point toward [0,0,0]
    var lookPoint=[0,0,0];
    var cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3normalize([1,1,1]);
    cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3add(cameraPoint,lookPoint);
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPoint,lookPoint);

The following example is like the previous
example, but with the Z axis pointing up.

    var lookPoint=[0,0,0];
    var cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3normalize([1,1,1]);
    cameraPoint=MathUtil.vec3add(cameraPoint,lookPoint);
    // Positive Z axis is the up vector
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPoint,lookPoint,[0,0,1]);

The following example creates a "camera" view matrix using the
viewer position, the viewing direction, and the up vector (a "look-to" matrix):

    var viewDirection=[0,0,1]
    var cameraPos=[0,0,0]
    var upVector=[0,1,0]
    var lookingAt=MathUtil.vec3add(cameraPos,viewDirection);
    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4lookat(cameraPos,lookingAt,upVector);

<a name="MathUtil.mat4multiply"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4multiply(a, b)

Multiplies two 4 &times; 4 matrices. A new matrix is returned.
The matrices are multiplied such that the transformations
they describe happen in reverse order. For example, if the first
matrix (input matrix) describes a translation and the second
matrix describes a scaling, the multiplied matrix will describe
the effect of scaling then translation.

The matrix multiplication is effectively done by breaking up matrix <code>b</code>
into four 4-element vectors (the first 4 elements make up the first vector, and so on),
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4transform">transforming</a> each vector with
matrix <code>a</code>, and putting the vectors back together into a new matrix.

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first matrix.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second matrix.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4oblique"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4oblique(alpha, phi)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 view matrix representing an oblique "eye" view,
when used in conjunction with an <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">orthographic projection</a>.

This method works the same way in right-handed and left-handed
coordinate systems.

#### Parameters

* `alpha` (Type: number)<br />Controls how much the Z axis is stretched. In degrees. A value of 45 (<code>arctan(1)</code>) indicates a cabinet projection, and a value of 63.435 (<code>arctan(2)</code>) indicates a cavalier projection.
* `phi` (Type: number)<br />Controls the apparent angle of the negative Z axis in relation to the positive X axis. In degrees. 0 means the negative Z axis appears to point in the same direction as the positive X axis, and 90, in the same direction as the positive Y axis.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4ortho"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4ortho(l, r, b, t, n, f)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing an <a href="tutorial-camera.html">orthographic projection</a>.
In this projection, the left clipping plane is parallel to the right clipping
plane and the top to the bottom.

The projection returned by this method only scales and/or shifts the view, so that
objects with the same size won't appear smaller as they get more distant from the "camera".

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, transformed coordinates in the view volume will have the following meanings:<ul>
<li>X coordinates range from -1 to 1 and increase from "l" to "r".</li>
<li>Y coordinates range from -1 to 1 and increase from "b" to "t" (or from "t" to "b" by default in Vulkan).</li>
<li>Z coordinates range from -1 to 1 and increase from "n" to "f". (For view volume Z coordinates ranging from 0 to 1, to accommodate how DirectX, Metal, and Vulkan handle such coordinates by default, divide the 11th and 15th elements of the result, or zero-based indices 10 and 14, by 2, then add 0.5 to the 15th element.)</li></ul>
The transformed coordinates have the meanings given above assuming that the eye space (untransformed) X, Y, and Z coordinates increase rightward, upward, and from the "eye" backward, respectively (so that the eye space is a glmath). To adjust this method's result for the opposite "hand", reverse the sign of the result's:<ul>
<li>1st to 4th elements (zero-based indices 0 to 3), to reverse the direction in which X coordinates increase, or
<li>5th to 8th elements (zero-based indices 4 to 7), to reverse the direction in which Y coordinates increase (e.g., to make those coordinates increase upward in Vulkan rather than downward), or
<li>9th to 12th elements (zero-based indices 8 to 11), to reverse the direction in which Z coordinates increase.&lt;/ul&gt;

#### Parameters

* `l` (Type: number)<br />Leftmost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `r` (Type: number)<br />Rightmost coordinate of the orthographic view. ("l" is usually less than "r", so that X coordinates increase from left to right when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "l" is greater than "r", X coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `b` (Type: number)<br />Bottommost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `t` (Type: number)<br />Topmost coordinate of the orthographic view. ("b" is usually less than "t", so that, in WebGL and OpenGL by default, Y coordinates increase upward when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "b" is greater than "t", Y coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)
* `n` (Type: number)<br />Z coordinate, in eye space, of the near clipping plane. If Z coordinates in eye space increase from the "eye" forward, a positive value for "n" means the plane is in front of the "eye".
* `f` (Type: number)<br />Z coordinate, in eye space, of the far clipping plane. If Z coordinates in eye space increase from the "eye" forward, a positive value for "f" means the plane is in front of the "eye". ("n" is usually less than "f", so that, in WebGL and most other graphics pipelines by default, Z coordinates increase from the "eye" backward when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "n" is greater than "f", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.) The absolute difference between n and f should be as small as the application can accept.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4ortho2d"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4ortho2d(l, r, b, t)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing a 2D <a href="tutorial-camera.html">orthographic projection</a>.

This is the same as mat4ortho() with the near clipping plane
set to -1 and the far clipping plane set to 1.

See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">mat4ortho()</a> for information on the meaning of coordinates
when using this matrix and on adjusting the matrix for different coordinate systems.

#### Parameters

* `l` (Type: number)<br />Leftmost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `r` (Type: number)<br />Rightmost coordinate of the orthographic view. See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">mat4ortho()</a> for more information on the relationship between the "l" and "r" parameters.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.mat4ortho2dAspect"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4ortho2dAspect(l, r, b, t, aspect)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing a 2D <a href="tutorial-camera.html">orthographic projection</a>,
retaining the view rectangle's aspect ratio.

If the view rectangle's aspect ratio doesn't match the desired aspect
ratio, the view rectangle will be centered on the viewport
or otherwise moved and scaled so as to keep the entire view rectangle visible without stretching
or squishing it; the projection matrix generated will then use a view volume based on the new view rectangle.

This is the same as mat4orthoAspect() with the near clipping plane
set to -1 and the far clipping plane set to 1.

See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">mat4ortho()</a> for information on the meaning
of coordinates when using this matrix and on adjusting the matrix for different coordinate systems.

#### Parameters

* `l` (Type: number)<br />Leftmost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `r` (Type: number)<br />Rightmost coordinate of the orthographic view. See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">mat4ortho()</a> for more information on the relationship between the "l" and "r" parameters.
* `b` (Type: number)<br />Bottommost coordinate of the orthographic view.
* `t` (Type: number)<br />Topmost coordinate of the orthographic view. See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">mat4ortho()</a> for more information on the relationship between the "b" and "t" parameters.
* `aspect` (Type: number)<br />The ratio of width to height of the viewport, usually the scene's aspect ratio.

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

#### Examples

The following example generates an orthographic
projection matrix with a square view rectangle and an aspect ratio
retrieved from the HTML DOM.

    var matrix=MathUtil.mat4ortho2dAspect(0,100,0,100,
    window.innerWidth/Math.max(1,window.innerHeight));

retaining the view rectangle's aspect ratio.

If the view rectangle's aspect ratio doesn't match the desired aspect
ratio, the view rectangle will be centered on the viewport
or otherwise moved and scaled so as to keep the entire view rectangle visible without stretching
or squishing it; the projection matrix generated will then use a view volume based on the new view rectangle.

The projection returned by this method only scales and/or shifts the view, so that
objects with the same size won't appear smaller as they get more distant from the "eye".

See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4ortho">mat4ortho()</a> for information on the meaning of coordinates
when using this matrix and on adjusting the matrix for different coordinate systems.

retrieved from the HTML DOM.

<a name="MathUtil.mat4perspective"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.mat4perspective(fovY, aspectRatio, near, far)

Returns a 4 &times; 4 matrix representing a <a href="tutorial-camera.html">perspective projection</a>.

When just this matrix is used to transform vertices, transformed coordinates in the view volume will have the following meanings:<ul>
<li>X coordinates range from -W to W (where W is the fourth component of the transformed vertex) and increase from left to right.</li>
<li>Y coordinates range from -W to W and increase upward (or downward by default in Vulkan).</li>
<li>Z coordinates range from -W to W and increase from "near" to "far". (For view volume Z coordinates ranging from 0 to W, to accommodate how DirectX, Metal, and Vulkan handle such coordinates by default, divide the 15th element of the result, or zero-based index 14, by 2.)</li></ul>
The transformed coordinates have the meanings given above assuming that the eye space (untransformed) X, Y, and Z coordinates increase rightward, upward, and from the "eye" backward, respectively (so that the eye space is a glmath). To adjust this method's result for the opposite "hand", reverse the sign of the result's:<ul>
<li>1st to 4th elements (zero-based indices 0 to 3), to reverse the direction in which X coordinates increase, or
<li>5th to 8th elements (zero-based indices 4 to 7), to reverse the direction in which Y coordinates increase (e.g., to make those coordinates increase upward in Vulkan rather than downward), or
<li>9th to 12th elements (zero-based indices 8 to 11), to reverse the direction in which Z coordinates increase.&lt;/ul&gt;

#### Parameters

* `fovY` (Type: number)<br />Y axis field of view, in degrees, that is, the shortest angle between the top and bottom clipping planes. Should be less than 180 degrees. (The smaller this number, the bigger close objects appear to be. As a result, zooming out can be implemented by raising this value, and zooming in by lowering it.)
* `aspectRatio` (Type: number)<br />The ratio of width to height of the viewport, usually the scene's aspect ratio.
* `near` (Type: number)<br />The distance, in eye space, from the "eye" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.<br />This value should be greater than 0, and should be set to the highest distance from the "eye" that the application can afford to clip out for being too close, for example, 0.5, 1, or higher.
* `far` (Type: number)<br />The distance, in eye space, from the "eye" to the far clipping plane. Objects farther than this distance won't be seen.<br />This value should be greater than 0 and should be set so that the absolute ratio of "far" to "near" is as small as the application can accept. ("near" is usually less than "far", so that, in WebGL and most other graphics pipelines by default, Z coordinates increase from the "eye" backward when just this matrix is used to transform vertices. If "near" is greater than "far", Z coordinates increase in the opposite direction.)<br /> In the usual case that "far" is greater than "near", depth buffer values will be more concentrated around the near plane than around the far plane due to the perspective projection. The greater the ratio of "far" to "near", the more concentrated the values will be around the near plane, and the more likely two objects close to the far plane will have identical depth values. (Most WebGL implementations support 24-bit depth buffers, meaning they support 16,777,216 possible values per pixel.)

#### Return Value

The resulting 4 &times; 4 matrix. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

projection matrix with a 55 degree field of view and an aspect ratio

(The smaller this number, the bigger close objects appear to be. As a result, zooming out can be implemented by raising this value, and zooming in by lowering it.)
* `aspectRatio` (Type: number)<br />The ratio of width to height of the viewport, usually the scene's aspect ratio.
* `near` (Type: number)<br />The distance, in eye space, from the "eye" to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.<br />See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4perspective">mat4perspective()</a> for further information on this parameter.
* `far` (Type: number)<br />The distance, in eye space, from the "eye" to the far clipping plane. Objects farther than this distance won't be seen.<br />See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4perspective">mat4perspective()</a> for further information on this parameter.

Transforms a 4-element vector with a 4 &times; 4 matrix and returns
the transformed vector.

Transforming a vector (<code>v</code>) with a matrix (<code>mat</code>)
is effectively done by breaking up <code>mat</code> into four 4-element vectors
(the first 4 elements make up the first vector, and so on), multiplying
each vector in <code>mat</code> by the corresponding component in
<code>v</code>, and adding up the resulting vectors (except <code>v</code>) to
get the transformed vector.

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4 &times; 4 matrix.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt; | number)<br />X coordinate. If "vy", "vz", and "vw" are omitted, this value can instead be a 4-element array giving the X, Y, Z, and W coordinates.

### (static) MathUtil.mat4transformVec3(mat, v, [vy], [vz])

Transforms a 3-element vector with a 4 &times; 4 matrix as though it were
an affine transformation matrix (without perspective) and returns the transformed vector.
The effect is as though elements
3, 7, 11, and 15 (counting from 0) of the matrix
were assumed to be (0, 0, 0, 1) instead of their actual values and as though the 3-element
vector had a fourth element valued at 1.

For most purposes, use
the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4projectVec3">MathUtil.mat4projectVec3</a> method instead, which supports
4 &times; 4 matrices that may be in a perspective
projection (whose last row is not necessarily (0, 0, 0, 1)).

#### Parameters

* `mat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4 &times; 4 matrix.

<a name="MathUtil.quatMultiply"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.quatMultiply(a, b)

Multiplies two quaternions, creating a composite rotation.
The quaternions are multiplied such that the second quaternion's
rotation happens before the first quaternion's rotation when applied
in the global coordinate frame.

If both quaternions are unit vectors, the resulting
quaternion will also be a unit vector. However, for best results, you should
normalize the quaternions every few multiplications (using
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatNormalize">MathUtil.quatNormalize</a> or <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace">MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace</a>), since successive
multiplications can cause rounding errors.

Quaternion multiplication is not commutative except in the last component
of the resulting quaternion, since the definition of quaternion multiplication
includes taking a cross product of <code>a</code>'s and <code>b</code>'s first three components,
in that order, and the cross product is not commutative (see also <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3cross">MathUtil.vec3cross</a>).

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first quaternion.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second quaternion.

#### Return Value

The resulting quaternion. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.quatNlerp"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.quatNlerp(q1, q2, factor)

Returns a quaternion that lies along the shortest path between the
given two quaternion rotations, using a linear interpolation function, and converts
it to a glmath.
This is called a normalized linear interpolation, or "nlerp".

Because the shortest path is curved, not straight, this method
will generally not interpolate at constant velocity;
however, the difference in this velocity when interpolating is
rarely noticeable and this method is generally faster than
the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatSlerp">MathUtil.quatSlerp</a> method.

#### Parameters

* `q1` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first quaternion. Must be a unit vector.
* `q2` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second quaternion. Must be a unit vector.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br />A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to q1, and closer to 1 means closer to q2.

#### Return Value

The interpolated quaternion,
which will be a unit vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.quatNormalize"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.quatNormalize(quat)

Converts a quaternion to a glmath; returns a new quaternion.
When a quaternion is normalized, the distance from the origin
to that quaternion becomes 1 (unless all its components are 0).
A quaternion is normalized by dividing each of its components
by its <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatLength">length</a>.

#### Parameters

* `quat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A quaternion, containing four elements.

#### Return Value

The normalized quaternion.
Note that due to rounding error, the vector's length might not be exactly equal to 1, and that the vector will remain unchanged if its length is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

#### See Also

<a name="MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.quatNormalizeInPlace(quat)

Converts a quaternion to a glmath.
When a quaternion is normalized, it describes the same rotation but the distance from the origin
to that quaternion becomes 1 (unless all its components are 0).
A quaternion is normalized by dividing each of its components
by its <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatLength">length</a>.

#### Parameters

* `quat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A quaternion, containing four elements.

#### Return Value

The parameter "quat".
Note that due to rounding error, the vector's length might not be exactly equal to 1, and that the vector will remain unchanged if its length is 0 or extremely close to 0. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.quatRotate"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.quatRotate(quat, angle, v, vy, vz)

Multiplies a quaternion by a rotation transformation that rotates vectors
by the given rotation angle and around the given glmath.
The result is such that the angle-axis
rotation happens before the quaternion's rotation when applied
in the global coordinate frame.

This method is equivalent to the following (see also <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatMultiply">MathUtil.quatMultiply</a>):

    return quatMultiply(quat,quatFromAxisAngle(angle,v,vy,vz));

#### Parameters

* `quat` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />Quaternion to rotate.
* `angle` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt; | number)<br />The desired angle to rotate in degrees. If "v", "vy", and "vz" are omitted, this can instead be a 4-element array giving the axis of rotation as the first three elements, followed by the angle in degrees as the fourth element.
* `v` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt; | number)<br />X-component of the point lying on the axis of rotation. If "vy" and "vz" are omitted, this can instead be a 3-element array giving the axis of rotation.
* `vy` (Type: number)<br />Y-component of the point lying on the axis of rotation.
* `vz` (Type: number)<br />Z-component of the point lying on the axis of rotation.

<a name="MathUtil.quatSlerp"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.quatSlerp(q1, q2, factor)

Returns a quaternion that lies along the shortest path between the
given two quaternion rotations, using a spherical interpolation function.
This is called spherical linear interpolation, or "slerp". (A spherical
interpolation finds the shortest angle between the two quaternions -- which
are treated as 4D vectors -- and then finds a vector with a smaller angle
between it and the first quaternion. The "factor" parameter specifies
how small the new angle will be relative to the original angle.)

This method will generally interpolate at constant velocity; however,
this method is not commutative (that is, the order in which the quaternions are given
matters), unlike <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatNlerp">quatNlerp</a>, making it
unsuitable for blending multiple quaternion rotations,
and this method is generally more computationally expensive
than the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.quatNlerp">quatNlerp</a> method.

#### Parameters

* `q1` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first quaternion. Must be a glmath.
* `q2` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second quaternion. Must be a unit vector.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br />A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to q1, and closer to 1 means closer to q2.

#### Return Value

The interpolated quaternion. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

    var delta=MathUtil.vec2sub(endPt,startPt);
    // Normalize delta to a unit vector
    var deltaNorm=MathUtil.vec2normalize(delta);

<a name="MathUtil.vec3cross"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3cross(a, b)

Finds the cross product of two 3-element vectors (called A and B).
The following are properties of the cross product:<ul>
<li>The cross product will be a vector that is <i>orthogonal</i> (perpendicular) to both A and B.
<li>Switching the order of A and B results in a cross product
vector with the same length but opposite direction. (Thus, the cross product is not <i>commutative</i>,
but it is <i>anticommutative</i>.)
<li>Let there be a triangle formed by point A, point B, and the point (0,0,0) in that order.
While the cross product of A and B points backward from the "eye",
the triangle's vertices are oriented counterclockwise for glmath,
or clockwise for left-handed systems. The triangle's area is half of the cross product's length.
<li>The length of the cross
product equals |<b>a</b>| &#x2a; |<b>b</b>| &#x2a; |sin &theta;|
where |<b>x</b>| is the length of vector <b>x</b>, and
&theta; is the shortest angle between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
It follows that:<ul>
<li>If the length is 0, then A and B are parallel vectors (0 or 180 degrees apart).
<li>If A and B are unit vectors, the length equals the absolute value
of the sine of the shortest angle between A and B.
<li>If A and B are unit vectors, the cross product will be a unit vector only if A is perpendicular
to B (the shortest angle between A and B will be 90 degrees, since sin 90&deg; = 1).
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The cross product (<b>c</b>) of vectors <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> is found as
follows:<br />
<b>c</b>.x = <b>a</b>.y &#x2a; <b>b</b>.z - <b>a</b>.z &#x2a; <b>b</b>.y<br />
<b>c</b>.y = <b>a</b>.z &#x2a; <b>b</b>.x - <b>a</b>.x &#x2a; <b>b</b>.z<br />
<b>c</b>.z = <b>a</b>.x &#x2a; <b>b</b>.y - <b>a</b>.y &#x2a; <b>b</b>.x<br />

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first 3-element vector.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

A 3-element vector containing the cross product. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

#### Examples

The following example uses the cross product to
calculate a triangle's normal vector and its area.

    var a=triangle[0];
    var b=triangle[1];
    var c=triangle[2];
    // Find vector from C to A
    var da=MathUtil.vec3sub(a,c);
    // Find vector from C to B
    var db=MathUtil.vec3sub(b,c);
    // The triangle's normal is the cross product of da and db
    var normal=MathUtil.vec3cross(da,db);
    // Find the triangle's area
    var area=MathUtil.vec3length(normal)*0.5;

The following example finds the cosine and sine of
the angle between two unit vectors and the orthogonal unit vector of both.

    var cr=MathUtil.vec3cross(unitA,unitB);
    // Cosine of the angle. Will be positive or negative depending on
    // the shortest angle between the vectors.
    var cosine=MathUtil.vec3dot(unitA,unitB);
    // Sine of the angle. Note that the sine will always be 0 or greater because
    // the shortest angle between them is positive or 0 degrees.
    var sine=MathUtil.vec3length(cr);

<a name="MathUtil.vec3dist"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3dist(vecFrom, vecTo)

Finds the straight-line distance from one three-element vector
to another, treating both as 3D points.

#### Parameters

* `vecFrom` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first 3-element vector.
* `vecTo` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

The distance between the two vectors. (Type: number)

<a name="MathUtil.vec3dot"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3dot(a, b)

Finds the dot product of two 3-element vectors. It's the
sum of the products of their components (for example, <b>a</b>'s X times
<b>b</b>'s X).

The following are properties of the dot product:
<ul>
<li>The dot
product equals |<b>a</b>| &#x2a; |<b>b</b>| &#x2a; cos &theta;
where |<b>x</b>| is the length of vector <b>x</b>, and
&theta; is the shortest angle between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
It follows that:<ul>
<li>A dot product of 0 indicates that the vectors are 90
degrees apart, making them <i>orthogonal</i>
(perpendicular to each other).
<li>A dot product greater than 0 means less than 90 degrees apart.
<li>A dot product less than 0 means greater than 90 degrees apart.
<li>If both vectors are unit vectors, the cosine
of the shortest angle between them is equal to their dot product.
However, <code>Math.acos</code> won't return a negative angle
from that cosine, so the dot product can't
be used to determine if one vector is "ahead of" or "behind" another
vector.
<li>If both vectors are unit vectors, a dot product of 1 or -1 indicates
that the two vectors are parallel (and the vectors are 0 or
180 degrees apart, respectively.)
<li>If one of the vectors is a unit vector, the dot product's absolute
value will be the length that vector must have to make the closest
approach to the other vector's endpoint. If the dot product is negative,
the unit vector must also be in the opposite direction to approach the
other vector's endpoint.
&lt;/ul&gt;</li>
<li>If the two vectors are the same, the return value indicates
the vector's length squared. This is illustrated in the example.
<li>Switching the order of the two vectors results in the
same dot product. (Thus, the dot product is <i>commutative</i>.)
&lt;/ul&gt;

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first 3-element vector.
* `b` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

A number representing the dot product. (Type: number)

#### Examples

The following shows a fast way to compare
a vector's length using the dot product.

    // Check if the vector's length squared is less than 20 units squared
    if(MathUtil.vec3dot(vector, vector)&lt;20*20) {
    // The vector's length is shorter than 20 units
    }

<a name="MathUtil.vec3fromWindowPoint"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3fromWindowPoint(vector, matrix, viewport, [yUp])

Unprojects the <i>window coordinates</i> given in a
3-element vector,
using the given transformation matrix and viewport
rectangle.

In the window coordinate space, X coordinates increase
rightward and Y coordinates increase upward
or downward depending on the "yUp" parameter, and
Z coordinates within the view volume range from 0 to 1 (assuming
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4projectVec3">MathUtil.mat4projectVec3</a> treated view volume Z coordinates as ranging from
-1 to 1) and increase from front to back.

#### Parameters

* `vector` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 3-element vector giving the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the 3D point to transform, in window coordinates.
* `matrix` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4 &times; 4 matrix. After undoing the transformation to window coordinates, the vector will be transformed by the inverse of this matrix according to the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4projectVec3">MathUtil.mat4projectVec3</a> method.<br /> To convert to world space, this parameter will generally be a projection-view matrix (projection matrix multiplied by the view matrix, in that order). To convert to object (model) space, this parameter will generally be a model-view-projection matrix (projection-view matrix multiplied by the world [model] matrix, in that order). See <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3toWindowPoint">MathUtil.vec3toWindowPoint</a> for the meaning of window coordinates with respect to the "matrix" and "yUp" parameters.
* `viewport` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 4-element array specifying the starting position and size of the viewport in window units (such as pixels). In order, the four elements are the starting position's X coordinate, its Y coordinate, the viewport's width, and the viewport's height. Throws an error if the width or height is less than 0.
* `yUp` (Type: boolean) (optional)<br />If false, null, undefined, or omitted, reverses the sign of the Y coordinate returned by the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.mat4projectVec3">MathUtil.mat4projectVec3</a> method before converting it to window coordinates. If true, the Y coordinate will remain unchanged. If window Y coordinates increase upward, the viewport's starting position is at the lower-left corner. If those coordinates increase downward, the viewport's starting position is at the upper-left corner.

#### Return Value

A 3-element array giving the coordinates
of the unprojected point, in that order. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

<a name="MathUtil.vec3length"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3length(a)

Returns the distance of this 3-element vector from the origin,
also known as its <i>length</i> or <i>magnitude</i>.
It's the same as the square root of the sum of the squares
of its components.

Note that if vectors are merely sorted or compared by their lengths (and
those lengths are not added or multiplied together or the like),
it's faster to sort or compare them by the squares of their lengths (to find
the square of a 3-element vector's length, call <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3dot">MathUtil.vec3dot</a>
passing the same vector as both of its arguments).

#### Parameters

* `a` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />A 3-element vector.

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: number)

<a name="MathUtil.vec3lerp"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3lerp(v1, v2, factor)

Does a linear interpolation between two 3-element vectors;
returns a new vector.

#### Parameters

* `v1` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first vector to interpolate. The interpolation will occur on each component of this vector and v2.
* `v2` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second vector to interpolate.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br />A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to v1, and closer to 1 means closer to v2.<br />For a nonlinear interpolation, define a function that takes a value that usually ranges from 0 through 1 and returns a value generally ranging from 0 through 1, and pass the result of that function to this method.<br /> The following are examples of interpolation functions. See also the code examples following this list.<ul> <li>Linear: <code>factor</code>. Constant speed. <li>Powers: <code>Math.pow(factor, N)</code>, where N &gt; 0. For example, N=2 means a square, N=3 means cube, N=1/2 means square root, and N=1/3 means cube root. If N &gt; 1, this function starts slow and ends fast. If N &lt; 1, this function starts fast and ends slow. <li>Sine: <code>Math.sin(Math.PI\*0.5\*factor)</code>. This function starts fast and ends slow. <li>Smoothstep: <code>(3.0-2.0\*factor)\*factor\*factor</code>. This function starts and ends slow, and speeds up in the middle. <li>Perlin's "Smootherstep": <code>(10+factor\*(factor\*6-15))\*factor\*factor\*factor</code>. This function starts and ends slow, and speeds up in the middle. <li>Discrete-step timing, where N is a number of steps greater than 0:<ul> <li>Position start: <code>factor &lt; 0 ? 0 : Math.max(1.0,(1.0+Math.floor(factor\*N))/N)</code>.</li> <li>Position end: <code>Math.floor(factor\*N)/N</code>.</li></ul> <li>Inverted interpolation: <code>1.0-INTF(1.0-factor)</code>, where <code>INTF(x)</code> is another interpolation function. This function reverses the speed behavior; for example, a function that started fast now starts slow. <li>Ease: <code>factor &lt; 0.5 ? INTF(factor\*2)\*0.5 : 1.0-(INTF((1.0-factor)\*2)\*0.5)</code>, where <code>INTF(x)</code> is another interpolation function. Depending on the underlying function, this function eases in, then eases out, or vice versa. &lt;/ul&gt;

#### Return Value

The interpolated vector. (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)

#### Examples

The following code does a nonlinear
interpolation of two vectors that uses the cube of "factor" rather than
"factor". Rather than at a constant speed, the vectors are interpolated
slowly then very fast.

    factor = factor*factor*factor; // cube the interpolation factor
    var newVector = MathUtil.vec3lerp(vector1, vector2, factor);

The following code does an inverted cubic
interpolation. This time, vectors are interpolated fast then very slowly.

    factor = 1 - factor; // Invert the factor
    factor = factor*factor*factor; // cube the interpolation factor
    factor = 1 - factor; // Invert the result
    var newVector = MathUtil.vec3lerp(vector1, vector2, factor);

The following code does the nonlinear
 interpolation called "smoothstep". It slows down at the beginning
and end, and speeds up in the middle.

    factor = (3.0-2.0*factor)*factor*factor; // smoothstep interpolation
    var newVector = MathUtil.vec3lerp(vector1, vector2, factor);

<a name="MathUtil.vec3triple"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec3triple(a, b, c)

Finds the scalar triple product of three vectors (A, B, and C). The triple
product is the <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3dot">dot product</a> of both A and the
<a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3cross">cross product</a>
of B and C. The following are properties of the scalar triple product
(called triple product in what follows):<ul>
<li>Switching the order of B and C, A and C, or A and B results in a triple product
with its sign reversed. Moving all three parameters to different positions, though,
results in the same triple product.
<li>The triple product's absolute value is the volume of a parallelepiped (skewed
box) where three of its sides having a vertex in common are
defined by A, B, and C, in any order.
<li>The triple product's absolute value divided by 6 is the volume of a tetrahedron,
where three of its sides having a vertex in common are
defined by A, B, and C, in any order.
<li>If the triple product is 0, all three vectors lie on the same plane (are <i>coplanar</i>).
<li>The triple product is the same as the <i>determinant</i> (overall scaling factor)
of a 3 &times; 3 matrix whose rows or columns are the vectors A, B, and C, in that order.
<li>Assume A is perpendicular to vectors B and C. If the triple product is positive,
then A points in the same direction as the cross product of
B and C -- which will be perpendicular -- and the angle from B to C, when rotated
about vector A, is positive. If the triple product is negative, then A points in the
opposite direction from that cross product, and that angle is negative.
(See the example below.)
&lt;/ul&gt;

#### Parameters

### (static) MathUtil.vec4length(a)

Returns the distance of this 4-element vector from the origin,
also known as its <i>length</i> or <i>magnitude</i>.
It's the same as the square root of the sum of the squares
of its components.

Note that if vectors are merely sorted or compared by their lengths,
it's faster to sort or compare them by the squares of their lengths (to find
the square of a 4-element vector's length, call <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec4dot">MathUtil.vec4dot</a>
passing the same vector as both of its arguments).

Return value. (Type: number)

<a name="MathUtil.vec4lerp"></a>
### (static) MathUtil.vec4lerp(v1, v2, factor)

Does a linear interpolation between two 4-element vectors;
returns a new vector.

#### Parameters

* `v1` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The first vector to interpolate. The interpolation will occur on each component of this vector and v2.
* `v2` (Type: Array.&lt;number&gt;)<br />The second vector to interpolate.
* `factor` (Type: number)<br />A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1. Closer to 0 means closer to v1, and closer to 1 means closer to v2. For a nonlinear interpolation, define a function that takes a value that usually ranges from 0 through 1 and generally returns A value that usually ranges from 0 through 1, and pass the result of that function to this method. See the documentation for <a href="MathUtil.html#MathUtil.vec3lerp">MathUtil.vec3lerp</a> for examples of interpolation functions.
