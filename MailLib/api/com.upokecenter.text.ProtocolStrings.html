<pre>public final class ProtocolStrings extends Object
</pre>

<p>Contains methods for preparing user-facing protocol strings (such as user
 identifiers) for equality comparison and validity checking. Such strings can
 be _internationalized_, that is, contain characters beyond the Basic Latin
 block (U+0000 to U+007F) of the Unicode Standard. See RFC 8264. Currently
 there are four profiles for internationalized strings: two for strings
 serving as user identifiers, one for arbitrary single-line strings (such as
 passwords), and one for display names.</p>
<ul> <li>Other user-facing
 internationalized strings not expressly handled by this class include the
 following. Their preparation and comparison are outside the scope of this
 class. <br /> -- File and directory names. <br /> -- Domain names. <br /> --
 Text strings with multiple language versions (such as a checkbox's label or
 a dialog box's title). <br /> -- Profile data voluntarily entered by users.
 <br /> -- The text of article, post, and message bodies.</li><li>The methods
 in this class are not well suited for <i>collation</i>, or lexicographic
 ordering, which is a comparison of text strings that is usually
 language-dependent and goes beyond equality comparison. Further discussion
 on collation can be found in Unicode Technical Standard 10 (UTS 10),
 "Unicode Collation Algorithm".</li><li>As explained in UTS 10 sec. 1.6,
 collation serves the purposes of searching and selection (for example, searching by
 name or by title). However, this class is directed more to equality
 comparisons for authentication or authorization purposes, or to avoid
 creating multiple items that use the same string, rather than, say, to
 comparisons of names or parts of names for the purpose of showing matching
 records.</li></ul>
<p><b>Security Considerations</b></p>
<p>Many of the
 methods in this class take text strings and output text strings. However,
 specifying text strings as these methods do is not ideal if the string
 represents a password or other sensitive data, since strings are immutable
 in.NET and Java, so that they can't be modified, and the memory they occupy
 is not guaranteed to be cleared in a timely fashion due to garbage
 collection.</p>
<p>The methods in this class are not guaranteed to be
 "constant-time" (nondata-dependent) for all relevant inputs. Neither are
 string comparison methods (such as string.equals) necessarily guaranteed to
 be "constant-time". Certain attacks that involve encrypted communications
 have exploited the timing and other aspects of such communications to derive
 keying material or cleartext indirectly, or for example, to leak information
 about whether a user name and password were accepted by the server, or
 whether a user name or display name was already taken. This is an important
 consideration especially for strings representing account identifiers or
 passwords, even when comparing two such strings of the same length.</p>

<h3 id="isinidentifierclass">IsInIdentifierClass</h3>
<pre>public static boolean IsInIdentifierClass(String str) Determines whether the given string belongs in RFC 8264's IdentifierClass.  In general, the IdentifierClass contains all code points in the  FreeformClass, except certain uncommon letters and digits, spaces, as well  as punctuation and symbols outside the Basic Latin range (U+0000 to U+007F).
</pre>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>str</code> - A string to check.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>true</code> if the given string is empty or contains only
 characters allowed in RFC 8264’s IdentifierClass (in the contexts required);
 otherwise, <code>false</code>. Returns <code>false</code> if <code>str</code> is null.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="isinfreeformclass">IsInFreeformClass</h3>
<pre>public static boolean IsInFreeformClass(String str) Determines whether the given string belongs in RFC 8264's FreeformClass. In  general, the FreeformClass contains most letters, digits, spaces,  punctuation, and symbols in the Unicode standard, as well as all basic  printable characters (U+0021 to U+007E), but excludes control characters and  separators. Horizontal tab, U+0009, and other code points in the range  U+0000 to U+001F, are among the excluded characters.
</pre>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>str</code> - A string to check.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>true</code> if the given string is empty or contains only
 characters allowed in RFC 8264’s FreeformClass (in the contexts required);
 otherwise, <code>false</code>. Returns <code>false</code> if <code>str</code> is null.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="userpartenforce">UserpartEnforce</h3>
<pre>public static String UserpartEnforce(String str) Checks the validity of a string without spaces that can serve to identify a  user or account (a "userpart"), where the case of letters in the string is  mapped to lowercase. This checking is done using the UsernameCaseMapped  profile in RFC 8265.
</pre>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>str</code> - A string to prepare that represents a user or account identifier.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A userpart prepared under the UsernameCaseMapped profile in RFC 8265
 (among other things, the string will be converted to lowercase). Returns
 null if <code>str</code> is invalid under that profile (including if <code>str</code>
 is null or empty). For comparison purposes, return values of this method
 should be compared code point by code point (see RFC 8265, sec. 3.3.4).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usernameenforce">UsernameEnforce</h3>
<pre>public static String UsernameEnforce(String str) Checks the validity of a string that can serve to identify a user or account  (a "username"), where the string is made of one or more parts called  "userparts" separated by spaces (U+0020) and where the case of letters in  the string is mapped to lowercase. This checking is done using the  UsernameCaseMapped profile in RFC 8265.
</pre>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>str</code> - A string to prepare that represents a user or account identifier.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A username where each of its parts is prepared under the
 UsernameCaseMapped profile in RFC 8265 (among other things, the string will
 be converted to lowercase). Returns null if any of those parts is invalid
 under that profile (including if <code>str</code> is null or empty). Note that
 there will be as many spaces of separation between parts of the return value
 as between parts of the input; this method will not collapse multiple spaces
 (U+0020) into a single space. If such space collapsing on a string (or
 rejection of strings with multiple consecutive spaces) is desired, it should
 be done before that string is passed to this method. For comparison
 purposes, return values of this method should be compared code point by code
 point (see RFC 8265, sec. 3.3.4).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="userpartenforce-1">UserpartEnforce</h3>
<pre>public static String UserpartEnforce(String str, boolean preserveCase) Checks the validity of a string without spaces that can serve to identify a  user or account (a "userpart"), where the case of letters in the string is  either mapped to lowercase or preserved. This checking is done using the  UsernameCaseMapped or UsernameCasePreserved profile in RFC 8265.
</pre>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>str</code> - A string to prepare that represents a user or account identifier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

 prepare the string. If false, use the UsernameCaseMapped profile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A userpart prepared under the UsernameCaseMapped or
 UsernameCasePreserved profile in RFC 8265. Returns null if <code>str</code> is
 invalid under that profile (including if <code>str</code> is null or empty). For
 comparison purposes, return values of this method (with the same value for
 <code>preserveCase</code>) should be compared code point by code point (see RFC
 8265, secs. 3.3.4 and 3.4.4).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usernameenforce-1">UsernameEnforce</h3>
<pre>public static String UsernameEnforce(String str, boolean preserveCase) Checks the validity of a string that can serve to identify a user or account  (a "username"), where the string is made of one or more parts called  "userparts" separated by spaces (U+0020) and where the case of letters in  the string is either mapped to lowercase or preserved. This checking is done  using the UsernameCaseMapped or UsernameCasePreserved profile in RFC 8265.
