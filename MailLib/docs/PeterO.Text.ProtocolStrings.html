<p>## PeterO.Text.ProtocolStrings</p>

<pre>public static class ProtocolStrings
</pre>

<p>Contains methods for preparing user-facing protocol strings (such as user identifiers) for equality comparison and validity checking. Such strings can be <em>internationalized</em>, that is, contain characters beyond the Basic Latin block (U+0000 to U+007F) of the Unicode Standard. See RFC 8264. Currently there are four profiles for internationalized strings: two for strings serving as user identifiers, one for arbitrary single-line strings (such as passwords), and one for display names.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Other user-facing internationalized strings not expressly handled by this class include the following. Their preparation and comparison are outside the scope of this class.  – File and directory names.  – Domain names.  – Text strings with multiple language versions (such as a checkbox’s label or a dialog box’s title).  – Profile data voluntarily entered by users.  – The text of article, post, and message bodies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The methods in this class are not well suited for <i>collation</i>, or lexicographic ordering, which is a comparison of text strings that is usually language-dependent and goes beyond equality comparison. Further discussion on collation can be found in Unicode Technical Standard 10 (UTS 10), “Unicode Collation Algorithm”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As explained in UTS 10 sec. 1.6, collation serves the purposes of searching and selection (for example, searching by name or by title). However, this class is directed more to equality comparisons for authentication or authorization purposes, or to avoid creating multiple items that use the same string, rather than, say, to comparisons of names or parts of names for the purpose of showing matching records.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Security Considerations</b></p>

<p>Many of the methods in this class take text strings and output text strings. However, specifying text strings as these methods do is not ideal if the string represents a password or other sensitive data, since strings are immutable in.NET and Java, so that they can’t be modified, and the memory they occupy is not guaranteed to be cleared in a timely fashion due to garbage collection.</p>

<p>The methods in this class are not guaranteed to be “constant-time” (nondata-dependent) for all relevant inputs. Neither are string comparison methods (such as String.Equals) necessarily guaranteed to be “constant-time”. Certain attacks that involve encrypted communications have exploited the timing and other aspects of such communications to derive keying material or cleartext indirectly, or for example, to leak information about whether a user name and password were accepted by the server, or whether a user name or display name was already taken. This is an important consideration especially for strings representing account identifiers or passwords, even when comparing two such strings of the same length.</p>

### IsInFreeformClass</p>

<pre>public static bool IsInFreeformClass(
    string str);
</pre>

<p>Determines whether the given string belongs in RFC 8264’s FreeformClass. In general, the FreeformClass contains most letters, digits, spaces, punctuation, and symbols in the Unicode standard, as well as all basic printable characters (U+0021 to U+007E), but excludes control characters and separators. Horizontal tab, U+0009, and other code points in the range U+0000 to U+001F, are among the excluded characters.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>str</i>: A string to check.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p><code>true</code>  if the given string is empty or contains only characters allowed in RFC 8264’s FreeformClass (in the contexts required); otherwise,  <code>false</code> . Returns  <code>false</code>  if  <i>str</i>
 is null.</p>

<p><a id="IsInIdentifierClass_string"></a>
### IsInIdentifierClass</p>

<pre>public static bool IsInIdentifierClass(
    string str);
</pre>

<p>Determines whether the given string belongs in RFC 8264’s IdentifierClass. In general, the IdentifierClass contains all code points in the FreeformClass, except certain uncommon letters and digits, spaces, as well as punctuation and symbols outside the Basic Latin range (U+0000 to U+007F).</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>str</i>: A string to check.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p><code>true</code>  if the given string is empty or contains only characters allowed in RFC 8264’s IdentifierClass (in the contexts required); otherwise,  <code>false</code> . Returns  <code>false</code>  if  <i>str</i>
 is null.</p>

<p><a id="NicknameEnforce_string"></a>
### NicknameEnforce</p>

<pre>public static string NicknameEnforce(
    string str);
</pre>

<p>Checks the validity of a string serving as a “memorable, human-friendly name” for something (see RFC 8266), as opposed to that thing’s identity for authentication or authorization purposes (see sec. 6.1 of that RFC). This checking is done using the Nickname profile in RFC 8266. Such names are not intended to serve as URIs or file paths (see sec. 6.1 of that RFC).</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>str</i>: A string serving as a nickname for something.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p>A nickname prepared for enforcement under the Nickname profile in RFC 8266. Returns null if that string is invalid under that profile (including if  <i>str</i>
 is null or empty). Return values of this method should not be used for comparison purposes (see RFC 8266, sec. 2.3); for such purposes, use the NicknameForComparison method instead.</p>

<p><a id="NicknameForComparison_string"></a>
### NicknameForComparison</p>

<pre>public static string NicknameForComparison(
    string str);
</pre>

<p>Prepares for comparison a string serving as a “memorable, human-friendly name” for something (see RFC 8266), as opposed to that thing’s identity for authentication or authorization purposes (see sec. 6.1 of that RFC). This operation is done using the Nickname profile in RFC 8266. Such names are not intended to serve as URIs or file paths (see sec. 6.1 of that RFC).</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>str</i>: A string serving as a nickname for something.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p>A nickname prepared for comparison under the Nickname profile in RFC 8266. Returns null if that string is invalid under that profile (including if  <i>str</i>
 is null or empty). For comparison purposes, return values of this method should be compared code point by code point (see RFC 8266, sec. 2.4).</p>

<p><a id="OpaqueStringEnforce_string"></a>
### OpaqueStringEnforce</p>

<pre>public static string OpaqueStringEnforce(
    string str);
</pre>

<p>Checks the validity of a string serving as an arbitrary single-line sequence of characters, such as a passphrase. This checking is done using the OpaqueString profile in RFC 8265.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>str</i>: A string to prepare that represents an arbitrary single-line sequence of characters entered by a user.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p>A string prepared under the OpaqueString profile in RFC 8265. Returns null if that string is invalid under that profile (including if  <i>str</i>
 is null or empty). For comparison purposes, return values of this method should be compared code point by code point (see RFC 8265, sec. 4.2.3).</p>

<p><a id="UsernameEnforce_string_bool"></a>
### UsernameEnforce</p>

<pre>public static string UsernameEnforce(
    string str,
    bool preserveCase);
</pre>

<p>Checks the validity of a string that can serve to identify a user or account (a “username”), where the string is made of one or more parts called “userparts” separated by spaces (U+0020) and where the case of letters in the string is either mapped to lowercase or preserved. This checking is done using the UsernameCaseMapped or UsernameCasePreserved profile in RFC 8265.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><i>str</i>: A string to prepare that represents a user or account identifier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><i>preserveCase</i>: If true, use the UsernameCasePreserved profile to prepare each part of the string. If false, use the UsernameCaseMapped profile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p>A username where each of its parts is prepared under the UsernameCaseMapped or UsernameCasePreserved profile in RFC 8265. Returns null if any of those parts is invalid under that profile (including if  <i>str</i>
 is null or empty). Note that there will be as many spaces of separation between parts of the return value as between parts of the input; this method will not collapse multiple spaces (U+0020) into a single space. If such space collapsing on a string (or rejection of strings with multiple consecutive spaces) is desired, it should be done before that string is passed to this method. For comparison purposes, return values of this method (with the same value for  <i>preserveCase</i>
 ) should be compared code point by code point (see RFC 8265, secs. 3.3.4 and 3.4.4).</p>

<p><a id="UsernameEnforce_string"></a>
### UsernameEnforce</p>

<pre>public static string UsernameEnforce(

</pre>

<p>Checks the validity of a string that can serve to identify a user or account (a “username”), where the string is made of one or more parts called “userparts” separated by spaces (U+0020) and where the case of letters in the string is mapped to lowercase. This checking is done using the UsernameCaseMapped profile in RFC 8265.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>str</i>: A string to prepare that represents a user or account identifier.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>
