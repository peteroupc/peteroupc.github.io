<h1>Open Questions on the Bernoulli Factory Problem</h1>

<p><a href="mailto:poccil14@gmail.com"><strong>Peter Occil</strong></a></p>

<p><a id=Background></a></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Suppose there is a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability, $\lambda$. The goal is to use that coin (and possibly also a fair coin) to build a &quot;new&quot; coin that shows heads with a probability that depends on $\lambda$, call it $f(\lambda)$. This is the <em>Bernoulli factory problem</em>, and it can be solved only for certain functions $f$. (For example, flipping the coin twice and taking heads only if exactly one coin shows heads, the probability $2\lambda(1-\lambda)$ can be simulated.)</p>

<p>Specifically, the only functions that can be simulated this way <strong>are continuous and polynomially bounded on their domain, and map $[0, 1]$ or a subset thereof to $[0, 1]$</strong>, as well as $f=0$ and $f=1$. These functions are called <em>factory functions</em> in this page. (A function $f(x)$ is <em>polynomially bounded</em> if both $f$ and $1-f$ are greater than or equal to min($x^n$, $(1-x)^n$) for some integer $n$ (Keane and O&#39;Brien 1994). This implies that $f$ admits no roots on (0, 1) and can&#39;t take on the value 0 or 1 except possibly at 0 and/or 1.)</p>

<p>This page contains several questions about the <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html"><strong>Bernoulli factory</strong></a> problem.  Answers to them will greatly improve my pages on this site about Bernoulli factories.

<h2>Key Problems</h2>

<p>The following summarizes most of the problems raised by these open questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Suppose $f:[0,1]\to [0,1]$ is continuous and belongs to a large class of functions (e.g., the $k$-th derivative, $k\ge 0$, is continuous, Lipschitz, concave, strictly increasing, bounded variation, and/or Zygmund, or $f$ is real analytic).</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Exact Bernoulli factory</em>: <strong>Assuming $0\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1$, compute the Bernstein coefficients of a sequence of polynomials ($g_n$) of degree 2, 4, 8, ..., $2^i$, ... that converge to $f$ from below and satisfy: $(g_{2n}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it&#39;s rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$.</strong></li>

<p>This question involves solving the Bernoulli factory problem with polynomials.</p>

<p>In this question, a polynomial $P(x)$ is written in <em>Bernstein form of degree $n$</em> if it is written as&mdash; $$P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k {n \choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k},$$ where $a_0, ..., a_n$ are the polynomial&#39;s <em>Bernstein coefficients</em>.</p>

<p>The degree-$n$ <em>Bernstein polynomial</em> of an arbitrary function $f(x)$ has Bernstein coefficients $a_k = f(k/n)$.  In general, this Bernstein polynomial differs from $f$ even if $f$ is a polynomial.</p>

<p><a id=Main_Question></a></p>

<h3>Main Question</h3>

<p>Suppose $f:[0,1]\to [0,1]$ is continuous and belongs to a large class of functions (for example, the $k$-th derivative, $k\ge 0$, is continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, strictly increasing, bounded variation, and/or in the Zygmund class, or $f$ is real analytic or in Gevrey&#39;s hierarchy) (<strong>see note 4 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;</strong>).</p>

<ol>
<li>(<em>Exact Bernoulli factory</em>): Compute the Bernstein coefficients of a sequence of polynomials ($g_n$) of degree 2, 4, 8, ..., $2^i$, ... that converge to $f$ from below and satisfy: $(g_{2n}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it&#39;s rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$. (<strong>See note 5 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;.</strong>)  Assume $0\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1$ or $f$ is polynomially bounded.</li>
<li>(<em>Approximate Bernoulli factory</em>): Given $\epsilon &gt; 0$, compute the Bernstein coefficients of a polynomial or rational function (of some degree $n$) that is within $\epsilon$ of $f$.</li>
</ol>

<p>The convergence rate must be $O(1/n^{r/2})$ if the class has only functions with Lipschitz-continuous $(r-1)$-th derivative.  The method may not introduce transcendental or trigonometric functions (as with Chebyshev interpolants).</p>

<p>Without loss of generality, the following special cases are of interest to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The class has only functions with Lipschitz continuous $r$-th derivative where $r$ is 2 to 5.</li>
<li>The approximating polynomials are based on a linear combination or iterated Boolean sum of Bernstein polynomials (Butzer 1953; Micchelli 1973).  Examples: $B_n(2 f - B_n(f))$ and $r$ is 3 or 4, or $B_n(B_n(B_n(f))+3(f-B_n(f)))$ and $r$ is 5 or 6, where $B_n(f)$ is the Bernstein polynomial of degree $n$ of a function $f$. (See Güntürk and Li 2021.)</li>
<li>The approximating polynomial is a linear operator that is not positive and preserves polynomials of a higher degree than linear functions (e.g., the operator studied by Tachev (2022) preserves quadratic functions).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solving the Bernoulli factory problem with polynomials</h3>

<p>An <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions"><strong>algorithm</strong></a> simulates a factory function $f(\lambda)$ via two sequences of polynomials that converge from above and below to that function. Roughly speaking, the algorithm works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate U, a uniform random variate in $[0, 1]$.</li>
<li>Flip the input coin (with a probability of heads of $\lambda$), then build an upper and lower bound for $f(\lambda)$, based on the outcomes of the flips so far. In this case, these bounds come from two degree-$n$ polynomials that approach $f$ as $n$ gets large, where $n$ is the number of coin flips so far in the algorithm.</li>
<li>If U is less than or equal to the lower bound, return 1. If U is greater than the upper bound, return 0. Otherwise, go to step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result of the algorithm is 1 with probability <em>exactly</em> equal to $f(\lambda)$, or 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>However, the algorithm requires the polynomial sequences to meet certain requirements; among them, the sequences must be of Bernstein-form polynomials that converge from above and below to a factory function.  See the formal statement, next.</p>

<p><a id=Formal_Statement></a></p>

<h3>Formal Statement</h3>

<p>More formally, there must exist two sequences of polynomials, namely—</p>

<ul>
<li>$g_{n}(\lambda): =\sum_{k=0}^{n}a(n, k){n \choose k}\lambda^{k}(1-\lambda)^{n-k}$, and</li>
<li>$h_{n}(\lambda): =\sum_{k=0}^{n}b(n, k){n \choose k}\lambda^{k}(1-\lambda)^{n-k}$,</li>
</ul>

<p>for every integer $n\ge1$, such that—</p>

<ol>
<li>$a(n, k)\le b(n, k)$,</li>
<li>$\lim_{n}g_{n}(\lambda)=\lim_{n}h_{n}(\lambda)=f(\lambda)$ whenever $0\le\lambda\le 1$, and</li>
<li>$(g_{n+1}-g_{n})$ and $(h_{n}-h_{n+1})$ are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once they are rewritten to polynomials in Bernstein form of degree exactly $n+1$ (<strong>see note 5 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;</strong>),</li>
</ol>

<p>where $f(\lambda)$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$ (Nacu and Peres 2005; Holtz et al. 2011), and the goal is to find the appropriate values for $a(n, k)$ and $b(n, k)$.</p>

<p><a id=A_Matter_of_Efficiency></a></p>

<h3>A Matter of Efficiency</h3>

<p>However, ordinary Bernstein polynomials converge to a function at the rate $\Omega(1/n)$ in general, a result known since Voronovskaya (1932) and a rate that will lead to an <strong>infinite expected number of coin flips in general</strong>.  (See also my <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernsupp.html"><strong>supplemental notes</strong></a>.)</p>

<p>But Lorentz (1966) showed that if the function is positive and has a continuous $k$-th derivative, there are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients that converge at the rate $O(1/n^{k/2})$ (and thus can enable a <strong>finite expected number of coin flips</strong> if the function is &quot;smooth&quot; enough).</p>

<p>Thus, people have developed alternatives, including linear combinations and iterated Boolean sums of Bernstein polynomials, to improve the convergence rate. These include Micchelli (1973), Guan (2009), Güntürk and Li (2021a, 2021b), the &quot;Lorentz operator&quot; in Holtz et al. (2011) (see also &quot;<a href="#New_coins_from_old_smoothly"><strong>New coins from old, smoothly</strong></a>&quot;), Draganov (2014), and Tachev (2022).</p>

<p>These alternative polynomials usually include results where the error bound is the desired $O(1/n^{k/2})$, but nearly all those results (e.g., Theorem 4.4 in Micchelli; Theorem 5 in Güntürk and Li) have hidden constants with no upper bounds given, making them unimplementable (that is, it can&#39;t be known beforehand whether a given polynomial will come close to the target function within a user-specified error tolerance). (<strong>See note 4 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;.</strong>)</p>

<p><a id=A_Conjecture_on_Polynomial_Approximation></a></p>

<h3>A Conjecture on Polynomial Approximation</h3>

<p>The following is a <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernsupp.html#A_Conjecture_on_Polynomial_Approximation"><strong>conjecture</strong></a> that could help reduce this problem to the problem of finding explicit error bounds when approximating a function by polynomials.</p>

<p>Let $f(\lambda):[0,1]\to(0,1)$ have $r\ge 1$ continuous derivatives, let $M$ be the maximum of the absolute value of $f$ and its derivatives up to the $r$-th derivative, and denote the Bernstein polynomial of degree $n$ of a function $g$ as $B_n(g)$. Let $W_{2^0}(\lambda), W_{2^1}(\lambda), ..., W_{2^i}(\lambda),...$ be a sequence of functions on [0, 1] that converge uniformly to $f$.</p>

<p>For each integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2, suppose that there is $D&gt;0$ such that&mdash; $$|f(\lambda)-B_n(W_n(\lambda))| \le DM/n^{r/2},$$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$.  Then there is $C_0\ge D$ such that for every $C\ge C_0$, the polynomials $(g_n)$ of degree 2, 4, 8, ..., $2^i$, ..., defined as $g_n=B_n(W_n(\lambda) - CM/n^{r/2})$, converge from below to $f$ and satisfy: $(g_{2n}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it&#39;s rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$. (<strong>See note 5 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;.</strong>)</p>

<p>Equivalently (see also Nacu and Peres 2005), there is $C_1&gt;0$ such that the inequality $(PB)$ (see below) holds true for each integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2 (see &quot;Strategies&quot;, below).</p>

<p>My goal is to see not just whether this conjecture is true, but also which value of $C_0$ (or $C_1$) suffices for the conjecture, especially for any combination of the special cases mentioned at the end of &quot;<a href="#Main_Question"><strong>Main Question</strong></a>&quot;, above.</p>

<p><a id=Strategies></a></p>

<h3>Strategies</h3>

<p>The following are some strategies for answering these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finding a sequence of functions $(W_n(f))$ and an explicit and tight upper bound on $C_1&gt;0$ such that, for each integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2&mdash; $$\left|\left(\sum_{i=0}^k W_n\left(\frac{i}{n}\right)\sigma_{n,k,i}\right)-W_{2n}\left(\frac{k}{2n}\right)\right|=|\mathbb{E}[W_n(X_k/n)] - W_{2n}(\mathbb{E}[X_k/n])|\le \frac{C_1 M}{n^{r/2}},\tag{PB}$$ whenever $0\le k\le 2n$, where $M = \max(L, \max|f^{(0)}|, ...,\max|f^{(r-1)}|)$, $L$ is $\max|f^{(r)}|$ or the Lipschitz constant of $f^{(r-1)}$, $X_k$ is a hypergeometric($2n$, $k$, $n$) random variable, and $\sigma_{n,k,i} = {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n \choose k}=\mathbb{P}(X_k=i)$ is the probability that $X_k$ equals $i$. (<strong>See notes 5 and 6 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot; as well as &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernsupp.html#Proofs_for_Polynomial_Building_Schemes"><strong>Proofs for Polynomial-Building Schemes</strong></a>.</strong>)</li>
<li>Suppose that, for each integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2, there is a polynomial of degree $n$, $P_{n}(f)$, that is within $E(n)$ of $f(\lambda)$. (For example, $P_{n}(f)$ could be a linear combination of Bernstein polynomials.) Then I believe another way to answer this question is to find $C&gt;0$ such that the non-negative polynomial $Q_{n}(f) = (P_{2n}(f) + E(n) + E(2n)) - P_{n}(f)$, when rewritten to a degree-$(2n)$ polynomial in Bernstein form, has Bernstein coefficients no greater than $CM/n^{r/2}$, where $M$ and $r$ are as above.  In that case, I believe solving the problem will rely on bounds on the derivatives of $f$, $P_{n}(f)$, and/or $Q_{n}(f)$. (See Lemma 24 of Holtz et al. 2011 for example.)</li>
</ol>

<p><a id=Examples_of_Functions_to_Ponder></a></p>

<h3>Examples of Functions to Ponder</h3>

<p>The following are examples of functions worth pondering for these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>$f(\lambda)=\sin(\lambda\pi/2)=\cos((1-\lambda)\pi/2)$, which equals 0 at 0 and 1 at 1.</li>
<li>Functions whose $k$-th derivative ($k\ge 0$) is continuous but not Lipschitz continuous at 0 (and $\lambda$ can equal 0), such as if that derivative is $\lambda^\alpha$, where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, or $\lim_{z\to\lambda} z-z \ln(z)$, or $\lim_{z\to\lambda} -1/(2 \ln(z/2))$.</li>
<li>The function $1/2-(1-2\lambda)^{\alpha}\beta/2$ if $\lambda<1/2$ and $1/2+(2\lambda-1)^{\alpha}\beta/2$ otherwise, where $\alpha>0$ and $0\lt\beta\le 1$.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tossing Heads According to a Concave Function</h2>

<p><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/409174/concave-functions-series-representation-and-converging-polynomials"><strong>https://mathoverflow.net/questions/409174/concave-functions-series-representation-and-converging-polynomials</strong></a></p>

<p>Suppose $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ is continuous, polynomially bounded, and belongs to a large class of functions (for example, the $k$-th derivative, $k\ge 0$, is continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, strictly increasing, bounded variation, and/or in the Zygmund class, or $f$ is real analytic or in Gevrey&#39;s hierarchy) (<strong>see note 5 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;.</strong>).</p>

<p>Then find a non-negative random variable $X$ and a non-trivial series $f(\lambda)=\sum_{a\ge 0}\gamma_a(\lambda)$ such that $\gamma_a(\lambda)/\mathbb{P}(X=a)$ (letting 0/0 equal 0) has a simple <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html"><strong>Bernoulli factory algorithm</strong></a> (and is preferably a polynomial or rational function with rational Bernstein coefficients lying in $[0, 1]$).</p>

<ul>
<li>An example of $X$ is $\mathbb{P}(X=a) = p (1-p)^a$ where $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$ is a known rational.  That is, the probability of getting $a$ is $p (1-p)^a$.</li>
<li>The convergence rate must be $O(1/n^{r/2})$ if the class has only functions with Lipschitz-continuous $(r-1)$-th derivative.  The method may not introduce transcendental or trigonometric functions (as with Chebyshev interpolants).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Prove or disprove: Given that $f:[0,1]\to (0,1]$ is convex, the polynomials $(g_n) = (B_n(f) - \max_{0\le\lambda\le 1}|B_n(f)(x)-f(x)|)$ fulfill question 1 of &quot;<a href="#Main_Questions"><strong>Main Questions</strong></a>&quot; (except for the convergence rate).  So do the polynomials $(g_n) = (B_n(f) - |B_n(f)(1/2)-f(1/2)|)$, if $f$ is also symmetric about 1/2.</p>

<p><strong>See also Note 1 in &quot;<a href="#End_Notes"><strong>End Notes</strong></a>&quot;.</strong></p>

<p><a id=Using_a_Series_Expansion></a></p>

<h3>Using a Series Expansion</h3>

<p>One way to simulate a concave $f$ involves rewriting the concave function as the series&mdash; $$f(\lambda)=\sum_{a\ge 0}\gamma_a(\lambda)=\sum_{a\ge 0}\pi(a)\frac{\gamma_a(\lambda)}{\pi(a)},\tag{PC}$$ where&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>$\pi(a) = p (1-p)^a$ is the probability of getting a nonnegative integer $a$ in step 1 of the following algorithm, where $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$ is rational,</li>
<li>$\gamma_a(\lambda) = g_{n_{a}}(\lambda) - g_{n_{a-1}}(\lambda)$,</li>
<li>$g_n$ is the Bernstein polynomial for $f$ of degree $n$, with $g_{0} := 0$,</li>
<li>$(n_a)$ is an increasing sequence of positive integers, with $n_{-1} := 0$,</li>
<li>$\frac{\gamma_a(\lambda)}{\pi(a)}$, which will be a polynomial, must map $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$, and must not equal 0 or 1 anywhere on $(0, 1)$ unless it&#39;s a constant.  In the case of concave functions, this polynomial will always be nonnegative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then an algorithm to toss heads with probability equal to $f$ would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flip a coin that shows heads with probability $p$ until that coin shows heads.  Set $a$ to the number of tails.</li>
<li>Write $\frac{\gamma_a(\lambda)}{\pi(a)}$ as a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree $n_{a}$ (or a higher degree such that the Bernstein coefficients are all in [0, 1]). Flip the biased coin (with probability of heads $\lambda$) $n$ times, where $n$ is the polynomial&#39;s degree, and let $j$ be the number of heads.</li>
<li>Return 1 with probability equal to the polynomial&#39;s $j$th Bernstein coefficient ($j$ starts at 0), or 0 otherwise (see also Goyal and Sigman 2012 for an algorithm to simulate polynomials).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This algorithm has similarities to the one used in the proof in Keane and O&#39;Brien 1994.  That proof rewrites $f$ as a convex combination of polynomials in Bernstein form with only 0 and 1 as coefficients, namely as&mdash; $$f(\lambda)=\sum_{a\ge 1}\mathbb{P}(X=a) \sum_{i=0}^{k_a} \gamma_{a,i} {k_a \choose i} \lambda^i (1-\lambda)^{k_a-i},$$ where $X$ is an integer-valued random variable 1 or greater, each $\gamma_{a,i}$ is either 0 or 1, and $k_a$ is the degree of the polynomial labeled $a$.</p>

<p>However, using this technique for a given concave $f$ requires finding the appropriate sequence for $n_a$ and the appropriate value of $p$ so that the series expansion can be formed.  Here is an example for $\min(\lambda, 1-\lambda)$ which <em>appears</em> to be correct, but finding it was far from rigorous:</p>

<ul>
<li>$n_a = 2 \cdot 2^a$.</li>
<li>$p = 0.27$.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s also possible for $a$ to be generated in step 1 differently, perhaps with a Poisson distribution.  In that case, $\pi(a)$ will have to be changed to the corresponding probability of getting $a$ under the new distribution.</p>

<p>The focus is now on a <strong>specific approximation scheme</strong>, the one <strong>presented by <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00365-010-9108-5.pdf"><strong>Holtz et al. 2011</strong></a>, in the paper &quot;New coins from old, smoothly&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00365-010-9108-5.pdf"><strong>Holtz et al. 2011</strong></a>, in the paper &quot;New coins from old, smoothly&quot;, studied a family of polynomials $(Q_{n,r} f)$ (which they call the <em>Lorentz operators</em>) that approximate a continuous function $f$.</p>

<p>They used the Lorentz operators to build a family of polynomials $(g_n)$ that converge from below to $f$ and satisfy the following: $(g_{2n}−g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients, once it&#39;s rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$.</p>

<p>They proved, among other results, the following:</p>

<p>A function $f(\lambda):[0,1]\to(0,1)$ admits a family $(g_n)$ described above that converges at the rate&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>$O((\Delta_n(\lambda))^\beta)$ if and only if $f$ is $\lfloor\beta\rfloor$ times differentiable and has a ($\beta-\lfloor\beta\rfloor$)-Hölder continuous $\lfloor\beta\rfloor$-th derivative, where $\beta&gt;0$ is a non-integer and $\Delta_n(\lambda) = \max((\lambda(1-\lambda)/n)^{1/2}, 1/n)$.  (Roughly speaking, the rate is $O((1/n)^{\beta})$ when $\lambda$ is close to 0 or 1, and $O((1/n)^{\beta/2})$ elsewhere.)</li>
<li>$O((\Delta_n(\lambda))^{r+1})$ only if the $r$th derivative of $f$ is in the Zygmund class, where $r\ge 0$ is an integer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme is as follows:</p>

<p>Let $f$ be a continuous and $r$-times differentiable function&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>that maps [0, 1] to the open interval (0, 1), and</li>
<li>whose $r$th derivative is $\beta$-Hölder continuous, where $\beta$ is in (0, 1).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let $\alpha = r+\beta$, let $b = 2^s$, and let $s\gt 0$ be an integer. Let $Q_{n, r}f$ be a degree $n+r$ approximating polynomial called a <em>Lorentz operator</em> (see the paper for details on the Lorentz operator). Let $n_0$ be the smallest $n$ such that $Q_{n_0, r}f$ has coefficients within [0, 1]. Define the following for every integer $n \ge n_0$ divisible by $n_{0}b$:</p>

<ul>
<li>$f_{n_0} = Q_{n_0, r}f$.</li>
<li><p>$f_{n} = f_{n/b} + Q_{n, r}(f-f_{n/b})$ for each integer $n &gt; n_0$.</p></li>
<li><p>$\phi(n, \alpha, \lambda) = \frac{\theta_{\alpha}}{n^{\alpha}}+(\frac{\lambda(1-\lambda)}{n})^{\alpha/2}$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let $B_{n}(F)$ be the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomial of $F$.</p>

<p>Let $C(\lambda)$ be a polynomial as follows: Find the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomial of $\phi(n, r+\beta, \lambda)$, then rewrite it as a degree-$n+r$ Bernstein polynomial.</p>

<p>Then the degree $n+r$ polynomial that approximates $f$ is&mdash; $$g(n, r,\lambda) = f_{n}(\lambda) - D \cdot C(\lambda)\tag{1}$$.</p>

<p>However, the Holtz method is not yet implementable, in part because it relies on hidden constants with no upper bounds given.</p>

<h2>Simulable and strongly simulable functions</h2>

<p><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/404961/from-biased-coins-and-nothing-else-to-biased-coins"><strong>https://mathoverflow.net/questions/404961/from-biased-coins-and-nothing-else-to-biased-coins</strong></a></p>

<p>There are two kinds of factory functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A function $f(\lambda)$ is <em>simulable</em> if an algorithm exists to toss heads with probability $f(\lambda)$ given a coin with probability of heads $\lambda$ (the &quot;biased coin&quot;) as well as a fair coin.</li>
<li>A function $f(\lambda)$ is <em>strongly simulable</em> if an algorithm exists to toss heads with probability $f(\lambda)$ given <strong>only</strong> a coin with probability of heads $\lambda$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every strongly simulable function is simulable, but not vice versa.</p>

<p>In fact, Keane and O&#39;Brien (1994) showed already that $f(\lambda)$ is strongly simulable if $f$ is simulable and neither 0 nor 1 is in $f$&#39;s domain (that is, if the biased coin doesn&#39;t show heads every time or tails every time).  And it&#39;s also easy to show that if $f$ is strongly simulable, then $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ must each be 0, 1, or undefined.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s not so trivial to find the exact class of strongly simulable functions when $f$&#39;s domain includes 0, 1, or both.</p>

<p>As one illustration of this, the proof of Keane and O&#39;Brien relies on generating a geometric random variate and using that variate to control which &quot;part&quot; of the target function $f(\lambda)$ to simulate.   This obviously works on all of [0, 1] if the algorithm uses both the biased coin and a separate fair coin.  However, if only the biased coin is used in the algorithm, the geometric random variate is generated using fair bits via the von Neumann method, which however will never terminate if $\lambda$ is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>The following <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernsupp.html#Which_functions_don_t_require_outside_randomness_to_simulate"><strong>result</strong></a> is another illustration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If $f(\lambda)$ is a factory function that meets the following conditions, then $f$ is strongly simulable.</p>

<ol>
<li>$f(0)$ and $f(1)$ must each be 0, 1, or undefined.</li>
<li>If $f(0) = 0$ or $f(1) = 0$ or both, then either $f$ must be constant on its domain or there must be a polynomial $g(\lambda)$ in Bernstein form whose coefficients are computable and in the interval [0, 1], such that $g(0) = f(0)$ and $g(1) = f(1)$ whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that $g(\lambda)$ &gt; $f(\lambda)$ for every $\lambda$ in the domain of $f$, except at 0 and 1.</li>
<li>If $f(0) = 1$ or $f(1) = 1$ or both, then either $f$ must be constant on its domain or there must be a polynomial $h(\lambda)$ in Bernstein form whose coefficients are computable and in the interval [0, 1], such that $h(0) = f(0)$ and $h(1) = f(1)$ whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that $h(\lambda)$ &lt; $f(\lambda)$ for every $\lambda$ in the domain of $f$, except at 0 and 1.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>And the proof proceeds by showing, among other things, that the Bernoulli factory for $f$ must flip the input coin and get 0 and 1 before it simulates any fair coin flips via the von Neumann trick.</p>

<p>Question: <strong>Does the result just given describe all the functions that are strongly simulable (using nothing but the biased coin) when the biased coin can show heads every time and/or tails every time?  If not, what is the exact class of strongly simulable functions?</strong></p>

<p>I suspect that $f:(D\subseteq [0, 1])\to [0,1]$ is strongly simulable if and only if&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>$f$ is constant on its domain, or is continuous and polynomially bounded on its domain, and</li>
<li>$f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are each 0, 1, or undefined, and</li>
<li>0 is not in the domain of $f$, or $f$ can be extended to a Lipschitz continuous function on $[0, \epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$, and</li>
<li>1 is not in the domain of $f$, or $f$ can be extended to a Lipschitz continuous function on $(1-\epsilon, 1]$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is suspected by observing that for every integer $n&gt;0$ and every Bernoulli factory function $f(x)$, $(1-(1-x)^n) \cdot f(x)$ is Lipschitz continuous at 0 with Lipschitz constant no more than $n$. ($(1-x)^n$ is the probability of the biased coin showing zero $n$ times in a row.)</p>

<h2>Multiple-Output Bernoulli Factories</h2>

<p><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/412772/from-biased-coins-to-biased-coins-as-efficiently-as-possible"><strong>https://mathoverflow.net/questions/412772/from-biased-coins-to-biased-coins-as-efficiently-as-possible</strong></a></p>

<p>Let $J$ be a closed interval on $(0, 1)$, and let $f(\lambda):J \to (0, 1)$ be continuous.</p>

<p>Then by Keane and O&#39;Brien, $f$ admits an algorithm that solves the Bernoulli factory problem for $f$ (using only the biased coin, in fact). A related problem is a Bernoulli factory that takes a coin with unknown probability of heads $\lambda \in J$ and produces <em>one or more</em> samples, at a time, of the probability $f(\lambda)$. This question calls it a <em>multiple-output Bernoulli factory</em>.</p>

<p>Obviously, any single-output Bernoulli factory can produce multiple outputs by running itself multiple times. But for some functions $f$, it may be that producing multiple outputs at a time may use fewer coin flips than producing one output multiple times.</p>

<p>Define the entropy bound as&mdash; $$h(f(\lambda))/h(\lambda),$$ where&mdash; $$h(x)=-x \ln(x)-(1-x) \ln(1-x),$$ is related to the Shannon entropy function.</p>

<p><a id=Questions_2></a></p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Given that a function $f(\lambda)$ is continuous and maps a closed interval in (0, 1) to (0, 1), is there a multiple-output Bernoulli factory algorithm for $f$ with an expected number of coin flips per sample that is arbitrarily close to the entropy bound, uniformly for every $\lambda$ in $f$&#39;s domain? Call such a Bernoulli factory an <em>optimal factory</em>.  (See Nacu and Peres 2005, Question 1.)</li>
<li>Does the answer to question 1 change if the algorithm can also use a fair coin in addition to the biased coin?</li>
</ol>

<p><a id=Functions_with_Optimal_Factories></a></p>

<h3>Functions with Optimal Factories</h3>

<p>So far, the following functions do admit an optimal factory:</p>

<ul>
<li>The functions $\lambda$ and $1-\lambda$.</li>
<li>Constants in [0, 1]. As Nacu and Peres (2005) already showed, any such constant $c$ admits an optimal factory: generate unbiased random bits using Peres&#39;s iterated von Neumann extractor (Peres 1992), then build a binary tree that generates 1 with probability $c$ and 0 otherwise (Knuth and Yao 1976).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to see that if an optimal factory exists for $f(\lambda)$, then one also exists for $1-f(\lambda)$: simply change all ones returned by the $f(\lambda)$ factory into zeros and vice versa.</p>

<p>Also, as Yuval Peres (Jun. 24, 2021) told me, there is an efficient multiple-output Bernoulli factory for $f(\lambda) = \lambda/2$: the key is to flip the input coin enough times to produce unbiased random bits using his extractor (Peres 1992), then multiply each unbiased bit with another input coin flip to get a sample from $\lambda/2$. Given that the sample is equal to 0, there are three possibilities that can &quot;be extracted to produce more fair bits&quot;: either the unbiased bit is 0, or the coin flip is 0, or both are 0.  This algorithm, though, might not count as an <em>optimal factory</em>, and Peres described this algorithm only incompletely.  Indeed, the correctness might depend on how the three possibilities are &quot;extracted to produce more fair bits&quot;; after all, the number of coin flips per sample, for every $\lambda$, must not surpass the entropy bound.</p>

<p>In any case, I believe that not all factory functions admit an optimal factory described here; especially because&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>the question may depend on $f$&#39;s range, and</li>
<li>the efficiency of even a <em>single-output</em> Bernoulli factory depends on $f$&#39;s smoothness (e.g., $O(1/n^{(r+\alpha)/2})$ only if $f$&#39;s $r$th derivative is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent $\alpha$; Holtz et al. 2011).</li>
</ul>

<h2>From coin flips to algebraic functions via pushdown automata</h2>

<p><a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/50853/from-coin-flips-to-algebraic-functions-via-pushdown-automata"><strong>https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/50853/from-coin-flips-to-algebraic-functions-via-pushdown-automata</strong></a></p>

<p>This section is about solving the Bernoulli factory problem on a restricted computing model, namely the model of <em>pushdown automata</em> (finite-state machines with a stack) that are driven by flips of a coin and produce new probabilities.</p>

<p><a id=Pushdown_Automata></a></p>

<h3>Pushdown Automata</h3>

<p>A <em>pushdown automaton</em> has a finite set of <em>states</em> and a finite set of <em>stack symbols</em>, one of which is called EMPTY and takes a biased coin with an unknown probability of heads. It starts with a given state and its stack starts with EMPTY. On each iteration:</p>

<ul>
<li>The automaton flips the coin.</li>
<li>Based on the coin flip (HEADS or TAILS), the current state, and the top stack symbol, it moves to a new state (or keeps it unchanged) and replaces the top stack symbol with zero, one, or two symbols. Thus, there are three kinds of <em>transition rules</em>:

<ul>
<li>(<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>symbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {<em>symbol2</em>}): move to <em>state2</em>, replace top stack symbol with same or different one.</li>
<li>(<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>symbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {<em>symbol2</em>, <em>new</em>}): move to <em>state2</em>, replace top stack symbol with <em>symbol2</em>, then <em>push</em> a new symbol (<em>new</em>) onto the stack.</li>
<li>(<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>symbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {}): move to <em>state2</em>, <em>pop</em> the top symbol from the stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>When the stack is empty, the machine stops and returns either 0 or 1 depending on the state it ends up at. (For the questions below, let <em>flip</em> be HEADS, TAILS, or a rational number in [0, 1]; this likewise reduces to the definition above.  The rest of this question assumes the pushdown automaton terminates with probability 1.)</p>

<p><a id=Algebraic_Functions></a></p>

<h3>Algebraic Functions</h3>

<p>Let $f: (0, 1) \to (0, 1)$ be continuous.  Mossel and Peres (2005) showed that a pushdown automaton can simulate $f$ only if $f$ is <em>algebraic over the rational numbers</em> (there is a nonzero polynomial $P(x, y)$ in two variables and whose coefficients are rational numbers, such that $P(x, f(x)) = 0$ for every $x$ in the domain of $f$).  The algebraic function generated by pushdown automata corresponds to a system of polynomial equations, as described by Mossel and Peres (2005) and Esparza et al. 2004.</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the class of continuous functions that map (0, 1) to (0, 1) and are algebraic over rationals.  The constants 0 and 1 are also in $\mathcal{C}$.</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ be the class of functions that a pushdown automaton can simulate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t yet know whether $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{C}$ (and that was also a question of Mossel and Peres).</p>

<p>The following section of my open-source page, <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernsupp.html#Pushdown_Automata_and_Algebraic_Functions"><strong>Pushdown Automata and Algebraic Functions</strong></a>, contains information on the question. That section sets forth the following results about the class $\mathcal{D}$:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\sqrt{\lambda}$ is in $\mathcal{D}$, and so is every rational function in $\mathcal{C}$.</li>
<li>If $f(\lambda)$ and $g(\lambda)$ are in $\mathcal{D}$, then so are their product and composition.</li>
<li>If $f(\lambda)$ is in $\mathcal{D}$, then so is every Bernstein-form polynomial in the variable $f(\lambda)$ with coefficients in $\mathcal{D}$.</li>
<li>If a pushdown automaton can generate a discrete distribution of <em>n</em>-letter words, then that distribution&#39;s probability generating function is in $\mathcal{D}$ (cf. Dughmi et al. 2021).</li>
<li>If a pushdown automaton can generate a discrete distribution of <em>n</em>-letter words of the same letter, it can generate that distribution conditioned on a finite set of word lengths, or a periodic infinite set of word lengths (e.g., odd word lengths only).</li>
<li>Every quadratic irrational in (0, 1) is in $\mathcal{D}$.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Questions_3></a></p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>For every function in class $\mathcal{C}$, is there a pushdown automaton that can simulate that function? (In other words, is $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{C}$?).</li>
<li>In particular, is min($\lambda$, $1-\lambda$) in class $\mathcal{D}$? What about $\lambda^{1/p}$ for some prime $p\ge 3$?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reverse-time martingales</h2>

<p>This section is withdrawn. For the Bernoulli factory problem, rational functions are probably not much better than polynomials when approximating functions with low smoothness (e.g., those with only three continuous derivatives).  This follows from Borwein (1979, theorem 29) and Holtz et al. (2011) (which disproved a theorem of Lorentz relied on by Borwein but maintained it with an extra assumption used in the Bernoulli factory setting).</p>

<h2>Other Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Given integer <em>m</em>&ge;0, rational number 0&lt;<em>k</em>&le;exp(1), and unknown heads probability 0&le;<em>&lambda;</em>&le;1, find a <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html"><strong>Bernoulli factory</strong></a> for&mdash; $$f(\lambda)=\exp(-(\exp(m+\lambda)-(k(m+\lambda)))) = \frac{\exp(-\exp(m+\lambda))}{\exp(-(k(m+\lambda)))},\tag{PD}$$ that, as much as possible, avoids calculating $h(\lambda) = \exp(m+\lambda)-k(m+\lambda)$; in this sense, the more implicitly the Bernoulli factory works with irrational or transcendental functions, the better.  A solution is sought especially when <em>k</em> is 1 or 2.   Note that the right-hand side of (PD) can be implemented by <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#ExpMinus_exp_minus__z"><strong>ExpMinus</strong></a> and division Bernoulli factories, but is inefficient and heavyweight due to the need to calculate $\epsilon$ for the division factory.  In addition there is a Bernoulli factory that first calculates $h(\lambda)$ and $floor(h(\lambda))$ using constructive reals and then runs <strong>ExpMinus</strong>, but this is likewise far from lightweight.  (Calculating exp(.) with floating-point operations is not acceptable for this question.)</li>
<li>Special case of &quot;<a href="#Tossing_Heads_According_to_a_Concave_Function"><strong>Tossing Heads According to a Concave Function</strong></a>&quot;: Let $f(\lambda):[0,1]\to [0,1]$ be writable as $f(\lambda)=\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n \lambda^n,$ where $a_n\ge 0$ is rational, $a_n$ is nonzero infinitely often, and $f(1)$ is irrational.  Then what are simple criteria to determine whether there is $0\lt p\lt 1$ such that $0\le a_n\le p(1-p)^n$ and, if so, to find such $p$?  Obviously, if $(a_n)$ is nowhere increasing then $1\gt p\ge a_0$.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/541402/what-are-relatively-simple-simulations-that-succeed-with-an-irrational-probabili"><strong>Simple simulation algorithms</strong></a>: What simulations exist that are &quot;relatively simple&quot; and succeed with an irrational probability between 0 and 1? What about &quot;relatively simple&quot; Bernoulli factory algorithms for factory functions?  Here, &quot;relatively simple&quot; means that the algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should use only uniform random integers (or bits) and integer arithmetic.</li>
<li>Does not use floating-point arithmetic, make direct use of irrational or transcendental functions or constants, or calculate the <em>p</em>-adic digit expansion of an irrational or transcendental function, for any real <em>p</em>.</li>
<li>Should not use rational arithmetic or increasingly complex approximations, except as a last resort.</li>

<p>See also Flajolet et al., &quot;On Buffon machines and numbers&quot;, 2010.  There are many ways to describe the irrational probability or factory function. References are sought to papers or books that describe irrational constants or factory functions in any of the following ways:</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Prove or disprove:</p>

<ol>
<li>Let $n≥1$ be an integer, and denote the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomial of $g$ as $B_n(g)$. Suppose $f(λ):[0,1]\to [0,1]$ is non-negative, is concave, and has a continuous second derivative. Then $U_{n,2}(f)=B_n(2f-B_n(f))$ is within $3Mλ(1−λ)/(n^2)$ and within $0.75M/(n^2)$ of f, where $M$ is the absolute value of the maximum of $f$&#39;s second derivative. (Note that Bustamante (2008)&#39;s theorem 11 can&#39;t be used here since $U_{n,2}$, though linear, is not a <em>positive</em> operator for all continuous functions on the closed unit interval.)</li>
<li>Statement 1&#39;s conclusion is true if the condition that $f$ is concave is replaced with the condition that $U_{n,2}(f)$ is non-negative for every $n\ge n_0$, for a fixed integer $n_0 \ge 1$.</li>
</ol>

<h2>End Notes</h2>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Besides the questions on concave functions given above, there is also the question of whether the solution terminates with a finite expected running time.  In this sense, Nacu &amp; Peres showed that a finite expected time is possible only if $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, and I strongly suspect it&#39;s not possible either unless $f$ has a Hölder continuous fourth derivative, in view of the results by Holtz given in the section &quot;New coins from old&quot;, smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: On pushdown automata: Etessami and Yannakakis (2009) showed that pushdown automata with rational probabilities are equivalent to recursive Markov chains (with rational transition probabilities), and that for every recursive Markov chain, the system of polynomial equations has nonnegative coefficients. But this paper doesn&#39;t deal with the case of recursive Markov chains where the transition probabilities cannot just be rational, but can also be $\lambda$ and $1-\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is an unknown rational or irrational probability of heads.</p>

<p><strong>Note 3</strong>: On pushdown automata: Banderier and Drmota (2014) showed the asymptotic behavior of power series solutions $f(\lambda)$ of a polynomial system, where both the series and the system have nonnegative real coefficients. Notably, functions of the form $\lambda^{1/p}$ where $p\ge 3$ is not a power of 2, are not possible solutions, because their so-called &quot;critical exponent&quot; is not dyadic. But the result seems not to apply to <em>piecewise</em> power series such as $\min(\lambda,1-\lambda)$, which are likewise algebraic functions.</p>

<p><strong>Note 4</strong>: An exception is Chebyshev interpolants, but my implementation experience shows that Chebyshev interpolants are far from being readily convertible to Bernstein form without using transcendental functions or paying attention to the difference between first vs. second kind, Chebyshev points vs. coefficients, and the interval [-1, 1] vs. [0, 1].  For purposes of these open questions, Chebyshev interpolants are impractical, and so are other approximating functions that introduce transcendental functions.  By contrast, other schemes (which are of greater interest to me) involve polynomials that are already in Bernstein form or that use only rational arithmetic to transform to Bernstein form (these include linear combinations and iterated Boolean sums of Bernstein polynomials).  Indeed, unlike with rational arithmetic (where arbitrary precision is trivial), transcendental functions require special measures to support arbitrary accuracy, such as constructive/recursive reals &mdash; floating-point numbers won&#39;t do for purposes of these open questions.</p>

<p>$g(\lambda)$ is in the Zygmund class if there is $D&gt;0$ such that $|g(x-h) + g(x+h) - 2g(x)|\le Dh$ wherever the left-hand side is defined and $0\lt h\le\epsilon$. $f(\lambda)$ is in <em>Gevrey&#39;s hierarchy</em> if there are $B\ge 1, l\ge 1, \gamma\ge 1$ such that $\max |f^{(n)}(\lambda)| \le Bl^n n^{\gamma n}$ for every $n\ge 0$) (see also Kawamura et al. 2015 which however relies on Chebyshev polynomials which are undesirable for my purposes).</p>

<p><strong>Note 5</strong>: This condition is also known as a &quot;consistency requirement&quot;; it ensures that not only the upper and lower polynomials &quot;decrease&quot; and &quot;increase&quot; to $f(\lambda)$, but also their Bernstein coefficients do as well.  This condition is equivalent in practice to the following statement (Nacu &amp; Peres 2005). For every integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2, $a(2n, k)\ge\mathbb{E}[a(n, X_{n,k})]= \left(\sum_{i=0}^k a(n,i) {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n\choose k}\right)$ and $b(2n, k)\le\mathbb{E}[b(n, X_{n,k})]$ whenever $0\le k\le 2n$ is an integer, where $X_{n,k}$ is a hypergeometric($2n$, $k$, $n$) random variable.  A hypergeometric($2n$, $k$, $n$) random variable is the number of &quot;good&quot; balls out of $n$ balls taken uniformly at random, all at once, from a bag containing $2n$ balls, $k$ of which are &quot;good&quot;.  See also my <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/429037/bounds-on-the-expectation-of-a-function-of-a-hypergeometric-random-variable"><strong>MathOverflow question</strong></a> on finding bounds for hypergeometric variables.</p>

<p><strong>Note 6</strong>: If $W_n(0)=f(0)$ and $W_n(1)=f(1)$ for every $n$, then the inequality $(PB)$ is automatically true when $k=0$ and $k=2n$, so that the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\lt 2n$.  If, in addition, $W_n$ is symmetric about 1/2, so that $W_n(\lambda)=W_n(1-\lambda)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, then the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\le n$ (since the values $\sigma_{n,k,i} = {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n \choose k}$ are symmetric in that they satisfy $\sigma_{n,k,i}=\sigma_{n,k,k-i}$).<br>This question is a problem of finding the <em>Jensen gap</em> of $W_n$ for certain kinds of hypergeometric random variables (<strong>see Note 5</strong>).  Lee et al. (2021) deal with a problem very similar to this one and find results that take advantage of $f$&#39;s (here, $W_n$&#39;s) smoothness, but unfortunately assume the variable is supported on an <em>open</em> interval, rather than a <em>closed</em> one (namely $[0,1]$) as in this question.</p>

<h2>My Attempt</h2>

<p>The Python script <a href="https://github.com/peteroupc/peteroupc.github.io/blob/master/lorentz.py"><strong>lorentz.py</strong></a> shows my attempt to implement the Holtz approximation scheme. It implements an algorithm to toss heads with probability equal to a piecewise polynomial factory function with continuous second or fourth derivative.  However, it relies on an unproven conjecture (Conjecture 34) in the Holtz paper.</p>

<p>Based on this attempt, the case of four continuous derivatives is efficient enough for my purposes, but the case of functions with lesser regularity is not so efficient (such as Lipschitz or two continuous derivatives).</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is my current progress for the Lorentz operator for $\alpha=2$, so $r=2$ (which applies to twice-differentiable functions with Hölder continuous second derivative, even though the paper appears not to apply when $\alpha$ is an integer). Is the following work correct?</p>

<p>The Lorentz operator for $r=2$ finds the degree-n Bernstein polynomial for the target function $f$, elevates it to degree $n+r$, then shifts the coefficient at $k+1$ by $-f\prime\prime(k/n) A(n,k)$ (but the coefficients at 0 and $n+r$ are not shifted this way), where:</p>

<p>$$A(n,k) = (1/(4n)) \times  2 \times (n+2-k)/((n+1)\times (n+2)),$$</p>

<p>where $k$ is an integer in $[0,n+r]$. Observing that $A(n,k)$ equals 0 at 0 and at $n+r$, and has a peak at $(n+r)/2$,
the shift will be no greater (in absolute value) than
$A(n,(n+r)/2)*F$, where $F$ is the maximum of the absolute value</p>

<p>of the second derivative of $f(\lambda)$.  $A(n,(n+r)/2)$ is bounded
above by $(3/16)/n$ for $n\ge 1$, and by $(3/22)/n$ for $n\ge 10$.</p>

<p>Now, find $\theta_\alpha$ for $\alpha=2$, according to Lemma 25:</p>

<p>Let $0&lt;\gamma&lt;2^{\alpha/2}-1$ ($\gamma&lt;1$ if $\alpha=2$).</p>

<p>Solve for $K$: $$(1-(1+\gamma)/2^{\alpha/2} - 4/(4*K)) = 0.$$  The solution for $\alpha=2$ is $K = 2/(1-\gamma)$.</p>

<p>Now find:  $$\theta_a = ((4/4) K^{\alpha/2}/n^\alpha) / ((1-(1+\gamma)/2^\alpha)/n^\alpha)$$ The solution for $\alpha=2$ is $\theta_a = 8/((\gamma-3) (\gamma-1))$.</p>

<p>For $\gamma=1/100$ and $\alpha=2$, $\theta_a = 80000/29601 &lt; 2.703$.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to check whether the output polynomials have Bernstein coefficients in $(0, 1)$, since out-of-bounds polynomials will be replaced with 0 or 1 as necessary &mdash; which is more practical and convenient.</p>

<p>Now all that remains is to find $D$ given $\alpha=2$. I believe this will involve the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find upper bounds for the constants $C_{19}$, $C_{21}$, and $C_{24}$ (used in Lemmas 19, 21, and 24, respectively) given $\alpha$ and $r$ (and for $C_{19}$ at least, the best I can do is a visual inspection of the plot).</li>
<li>Calculate $t = C_{24} C_{19} (1+2 C_{21}) b^{\alpha/2} M$, where $M$ is the Hölder constant of $f$&#39;s $r$th derivative (see &quot;Step 4&quot; in &quot;The Iterative Construction&quot;).</li>
<li>Find the maximum value of $(t (x+(1-x))^r B_n \Delta_n{\alpha}) / ((x+(1-x))^r B_n\phi_n)$ (the best I can do is a visual inspection), and set $D$ to that value.</li>
</ol>

<p>Moreover, there remains to find the parameters for the Lorentz operator when $r$ is 0, 1, 2, or 4. (When $r=0$ or $r=1$, the Lorentz operator is simply the Bernstein polynomial of degree $n$, elevated $r$ degrees to degree $n+r$.)</p>
