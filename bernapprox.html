<h1>Approximations in Bernstein Form</h1>

<p><a href="mailto:poccil14@gmail.com"><strong>Peter Occil</strong></a></p>

<p>This page describes how to compute a polynomial in Bernstein form that comes close to a known function $f(\lambda)$ with a user-defined error tolerance, so that the polynomial&#39;s coefficients will lie in the closed unit interval if $f$&#39;s values lie in that interval.  The polynomial is often simpler to calculate than the original function $f$ and can often be accurate enough for an application&#39;s purposes.</p>

<p>The goal of these approximations is to avoid introducing transcendental and trigonometric functions to the approximation method. (For this reason, although this page also discusses approximation by so-called <em>Chebyshev interpolants</em>, that method is relegated to the appendix.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This page was originally developed as part of a section on <em>approximate Bernoulli factories</em>, or algorithms that toss heads with probability equal to a polynomial that comes close to a continuous function.  However, the information in this page is of much broader interest than the approximate Bernoulli factory problem.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>This section describes certain math terms used on this page for programmers to understand.</p>

<p>The <em>closed unit interval</em> (written as [0, 1]) means the set consisting of 0, 1, and every real number in between.</p>

<p>For definitions of <em>continuous</em>, <em>derivative</em>, <em>convex</em>, <em>concave</em>, <em>Hölder continuous</em>, and <em>Lipschitz continuous</em>, see the definitions section in &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernsupp.html#Definitions"><strong>Supplemental Notes for Bernoulli Factory Algorithms</strong></a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Any polynomial can be written in <em>Bernstein form</em> as&mdash;</p>

<p>$${n\choose 0}\lambda^0 (1-\lambda)^{n-0} a[0] + {n\choose 1}\lambda^1 (1-\lambda)^{n-1} a[1] + ... + {n\choose n}\lambda^n (1-\lambda)^{n-n} a[n],$$</p>

<p>where <em>n</em> is the polynomial&#39;s <em>degree</em> and <em>a</em>[0], <em>a</em>[1], ..., <em>a</em>[<em>n</em>] are its <em>n</em> plus one <em>coefficients</em>.[^1]</p>

<p>A function $f(\lambda)$ is <em>piecewise continuous</em> if it&#39;s made up of multiple continuous functions defined on a finite number of &quot;pieces&quot;, or non-empty subintervals, that together make up f&#39;s domain.</p>

<p><a id=Approximations_by_Polynomials></a></p>

<h2>Approximations by Polynomials</h2>

<p>Suppose $f(\lambda)$ is continuous and maps the closed unit interval to the closed unit interval.</p>

<p>Then, a polynomial of a high enough degree (called $n$) can be used to approximate $f(\lambda)$ with an error no more than $\epsilon$, as long as the polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficients can be calculated and an explicit upper bound on the approximation error is available. See my <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/442057/explicit-and-fast-error-bounds-for-approximating-continuous-functions"><strong>question on MathOverflow</strong></a>.  Examples of these polynomials (all of degree $n$) are given in the following table.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In addition, by analyzing the proof of Theorem 2.4 of Güntürk and Li (2021, sec. 3.3)[^4], the following error bounds for $U_{n, 3}$ <em>appear</em> to be true:</p>

<ul>
<li>If $f(\lambda)$ has continuous fifth derivative: <em>&epsilon;</em> = 4.0421*max(<em>M</em><sub>0</sub>,...,<em>M</em><sub>5</sub>)/<em>n</em><sup>5/2</sup>.</li>
<li>If $f(\lambda)$ has continuous sixth derivative: <em>&epsilon;</em> = 4.8457*max(<em>M</em><sub>0</sub>,...,<em>M</em><sub>6</sub>)/<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernstein polynomials ($B_n(f)$) have the advantages that only one Bernstein coefficient has to be found per run and that the coefficient will be bounded by 0 and 1 if $f(\lambda)$ is.  But their disadvantage is that they approach $f$ slowly in general, at a rate no faster than a rate proportional to $1/n$ (Voronovskaya 1932)[^15].</p>

<p>On the other hand, polynomials other than Bernstein polynomials ($B_n(f)$) can approach $f$ faster in many cases than $B_n(f)$, but are not necessarily bounded by 0 and 1.  For these polynomials, the following process can be used to calculate the required degree $n$, given an error tolerance of $\epsilon$, assuming none of $f$&#39;s values is less than 0 or greater than 1.</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine whether $f$ is described in the table above.  Let <em>A</em> be the minimum of $f$ on the closed unit interval and let <em>B</em> be the maximum of $f$ there.</li>
<li>If 0 &lt; <em>A</em> &le; <em>B</em> &lt; 1, calculate $n$ as given in the table above, but with $\epsilon=\min(\epsilon, A, 1-B)$, and stop.</li>
<li>Propositions B1, B2, and B3 in the <a href="#Appendix"><strong>appendix</strong></a> give conditions on $f$ so that $W_{n,2}$ or $W_{n,3}$ (as the case may be) will be nonnegative.  If <em>B</em> is less than 1 and any of those conditions is met, calculate $n$ as given in the table above, but with $\epsilon=\min(\epsilon, 1-B)$. (For B3, set $n$ to max($n$, $m$), where $m$ is given in that proposition.) Then stop; $W_{n,2}$ or $W_{n,3}$ will now be bounded by 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Calculate $n$ as given in the table above.  Then, if any Bernstein coefficient of the resulting polynomial is less than 0 or greater than 1, double the value of $n$ until this condition is no longer true.</li>
</ol>

<p>The resulting polynomial of degree $n$ will be within $\epsilon$ of $f(\lambda)$.</p>

<li>$c$=floor($c/\delta + 1/2$) * $\delta$ (rounding to the nearest multiple),</li>
</ul>

<p>for each coefficient $c$.  The new polynomial will differ from the old one by at most $\delta$.  (Thus, to find a polynomial with multiple-of-$\delta$ coefficients that approximates $f$ with error $\epsilon$ [which must be greater than $\delta$], first find a polynomial with error $\epsilon - \delta$, then round that polynomial&#39;s coefficients as given here.)</p></li>

<h3>Taylor Polynomials for &quot;Smooth&quot; Functions</h3>

<p>If $f(\lambda)$ is &quot;smooth&quot; enough on the closed unit interval and if $\epsilon$ is big enough, then Taylor&#39;s theorem shows how to build a polynomial that comes within $\epsilon$ of $f$. In this section $f$ may but need not be writable as a power series (see note).</p>

<p>Let $n\ge 0$ be an integer, and let $f^{(i)}$ be the $i$-th derivative of $f(\lambda)$.  Suppose that&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>$f$ is continuous on the closed unit interval, and</li>
<li>$f$ satisfies $\epsilon\le f(0)\le 1-\epsilon$ and $\epsilon\le f(1)\le 1-\epsilon$, and</li>
<li>$f$ satisfies $\epsilon\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1-\epsilon$ whenever $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$, and</li>
<li>$f$&#39;s $(n+1)$-th derivative is continuous and satisfies $\epsilon\ge M/((n+1)!)$, where $M$ is not less than the maximum of the absolute value of that derivative, and</li>
<li>$f(0)$ is known as well as $f^{(1)}(0), ..., f^{(n)}(0)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the $n$-th <em>Taylor polynomial</em> centered at 0, given below, is within $\epsilon$ of $f$: $$P(\lambda) = a_0 \lambda^0 + a_1 \lambda^1 + ... + a_n \lambda^n,$$</p>

<p>where $a_0 = f(0)$ and $a_i = f^{(i)}(0)/(i!)$ for $i\ge 1$.</p>

<p>Items 2 and 3 above are not needed to find a polynomial within $\epsilon$ of $f$, but they <em>are</em> needed to ensure the Taylor polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficients will lie in the closed unit interval, as described after the note.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If $f(\lambda)$ can be rewritten as a <em>power series</em>, namely $f(\lambda) = c_0 \lambda^0 + c_1 \lambda^1 + ... + c_i \lambda^i + ...$ whenever $0\le\lambda\le 1$ (so that $f$ has a continuous $k$-th derivative for every $k$), and if the coefficients $c_i$&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>are each greater than 0,</li>
<li>form a nowhere increasing sequence (example: (1/4, 1/8, 1/8, 1/16, ...)), and</li>
<li>meet the so-called &quot;ratio test&quot;,</li>
</ul>

<p>then the algorithms in Carvalho and Moreira (2022)[^19] can be used to find the first $n$+1 coefficients such that $P(\lambda)$ is within $\epsilon$ of $f$ (see also the appendix).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the Taylor polynomial $P$, the algorithm to find the polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficients is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite $P(\lambda)$ as a polynomial in Bernstein form.  (One way to transform a polynomial to Bernstein form, given the &quot;power&quot; coefficients $a_0, ..., a_n$, is the so-called &quot;matrix method&quot; from Ray and Nataraj (2012)[^20].)  Let $b_0, ..., b_n$ be the Bernstein-form polynomial&#39;s coefficients.  If any of those coefficients is less than 0 or greater than 1, double the value of $n$ and rewrite $P$ to Bernstein form of degree $n$, until none of the coefficients is less than 0 or greater than 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result will be a polynomial of degree $n$ with $(n+1)$ Bernstein coefficients.</p>

<p><a id=Approximating_an_Integral></a></p>

<h3>Approximating an Integral</h3>

<p>Roughly speaking, the <em>integral</em> of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) on an interval [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>] is the &quot;area under the graph&quot; of that function when the function is restricted to that interval.  If <em>f</em> is continuous there, this is the value that $\frac{1}{n} (f(a+(b-a)(1-\frac{1}{2})/n)+f(a+(b-a)(2-\frac{1}{2})/n)+...+f(a+(b-a)(n-\frac{1}{2})/n))$ approaches as $n$ gets larger and larger.</p>

<p>If a polynomial is in Bernstein form of degree $n$, and is defined on the closed unit interval:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Approximating a Derivative</h3>

<p>If $f(\lambda)$ has a continuous $r$-th derivative on the closed unit interval (where $r$ is 1 or greater), it&#39;s possible to approximate $f$&#39;s $r$-th derivative as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build a polynomial in Bernstein form of a degree $n$ that is high enough such that the $r$-th derivative is close to $f$ with an error no more than $\epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is the user defined error tolerance.  See the table below.</li>
<li><p>Let $a[0], ..., a[n]$ be the polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficients. Now, to compute the polynomial&#39;s $r$-th derivative, do the following $r$ times or until the process stops, whichever happens first (Tsai and Farouki 2001, section 3.4)[^18].</p>

<ul>
<li>If $n$ is 0, set $a[0]=0$ and stop.</li>
<li>For each integer $k$ with $0\le k\le n-1$, set $a[k] = n\cdot(a[k+1]-a[k])$.</li>
<li>Set $n$ to $n-1$.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Approximations by Rational Functions</h2>

<p>Consider the class of rational functions $p(\lambda)/q(\lambda)$ that map the closed unit interval to itself, where $q(\lambda)$ is in Bernstein form with non-negative coefficients.  Then rational functions of this kind are not much better than polynomials in approximating $f(\lambda)$ when&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>the $k$-th derivative of $f$ is continuous on the open interval (0, 1), but not the $(k+1)$-th derivative (Borwein 1979, section 3)[^24], <em>or</em></li>
<li>$f(\lambda)$ is writable as $a_0 \lambda^0 + a_1 \lambda^1 + ...$, where $a_k\ge(k+1) a_{k+1}\ge 0$ whenever $k\ge 0$ (Borwein 1980)[^25].</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, rational functions are not much better than polynomials in approximating $f(\lambda)$ when&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>the $k$-th derivative of $f$ is continuous on the half-open interval (0, 1], but not the $(k+1)$-th derivative, <em>and</em></li>
<li>the rational function has no root that is a complex number whose real part is between 0 and 1 (Borwein 1979, theorem 29)[^24].</li>

<h2>Request for Additional Methods</h2>

<p>Readers are requested to let me know of additional solutions to the following problem:</p>

<p><em>Let $f(\lambda)$ be continuous and map the closed unit interval to itself.  Given $\epsilon\gt 0$, and given that $f(\lambda)$ belongs to a large class of functions (for example, it has a continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, or nowhere decreasing $k$-th derivative for some integer $k$, or any combination of these), compute the Bernstein coefficients of a polynomial or rational function (of some degree $n$) that is within $\epsilon$ of $f(\lambda)$.</em></p>

<p><em>The approximation error must be no more than a constant times $1/n^{r/2}$ if the given class has only functions with continuous $r$-th derivative.</em></p>

<p><em>Methods that use only integer arithmetic and addition and multiplication of rational numbers are preferred (thus, Chebyshev interpolants and other methods that involve cosines, sines, $\pi$, $\exp$, and $\ln$ are not preferred).</em></p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p><a id=Results_Used_in_Approximations_by_Polynomials></a></p>

<h3>Results Used in Approximations by Polynomials</h3>

<p><strong>Lemma A1:</strong> Let&mdash; $$f(x)=a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + ...,$$ where the $a_i$ are constants each 0 or greater and sum to a finite value and where $0\le x\le 1$ (the domain is the closed unit interval). Then $f$ is convex and has a maximum at 1.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> By inspection, $f(x)$ is a power series and is nonnegative wherever $x\ge 0$ (and thus wherever $0\le x\le 1$).  Each of its terms has a maximum at 1 since&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>for $n=0$, $a_0 x^0=a_0$ is a non-negative constant (which trivially reaches its maximum at 1), and</li>
<li>for each $n$ where $a_0 = 0$, $a_0 x^n$ is the constant 0 (which trivially reaches its maximum at 1), and</li>
<li>for each other $n$, $x^n$ is a strictly increasing function and multiplying that by $a_n$ (a positive constant) doesn&#39;t change whether it&#39;s strictly increasing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since all of these terms have a maximum at 1 on the domain, so does their sum.</p>

<p>The derivative of $f$ is&mdash; $$f&#39;(x) = 1\cdot a_1 x^0 + ... + i\cdot a_i x^{i-1} + ...,$$ which is still a power series with nonnegative values of $a_n$, so the proof so far applies to $f&#39;$ instead of $f$.  By induction, the proof so far applies to all derivatives of $f$, including its second derivative.</p>

<p>Now, since the second derivative is nonnegative wherever $x\ge 0$, and thus on its domain, $f$ is convex, which completes the proof. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition A2:</strong> For a function $f(x)$ as in Lemma A1, let&mdash; $$g_n(x)=a_0 x^0 + ... + a_n x^n,$$ and have the same domain as $f$.  Then for every $n\ge 1$, $g_n(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ of $f(x)$, where $\epsilon = f(1) - g_n(1)$.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> $g_n$, consisting of the first $n+1$ terms of $f$, is a power series with nonnegative coefficients, so by Lemma A1, it has a maximum at 1.  The same is true for $f-g_n$, consisting of the remaining terms of $f$.  Since the latter has a maximum at 1, the maximum error is $\epsilon = f(1)-g_n(1)$. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>For a function $f$ described in Lemma A1, $f(1)=a_0 1^0 + a_1 1^1 + ... = a_0 + a_1+...$, and $f$&#39;s error behavior is described at the point 1, so the algorithms given in Carvalho and Moreira (2022)[^19] &mdash; which apply to infinite sums &mdash; can be used to &quot;cut off&quot; $f$ at a certain number of terms and do so with a controlled error.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B1</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ map the closed unit interval to itself and be continuous and concave.  Then $W_{n,2}$ and $W_{n,3}$ (as defined in &quot;For Certain Functions&quot;) are nonnegative on the closed unit interval.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> For $W_{n,2}$ it&#39;s enough to prove that $B_n(f)\le f$ for every $n\ge 1$.  This is the case because of Jensen&#39;s inequality and because $f$ is concave.</p>

<p>For $W_{n,3}$ it must also be shown that $B_n(B_n(f)(\lambda))$ is nonnegative.  For this, using only the fact that $f$ maps the closed unit interval to itself, $B_n(f)$ will have Bernstein coefficients in that interval (each coefficient is a value of $f$) and so will likewise map the closed unit interval to itself (Qian et al. 2011)[^26].  Thus, by induction, $B_n(B_n(f)(\lambda))$ is nonnegative.  The discussion for $W_{n,2}$ also shows that $(f - B_n(f))$ is nonnegative as well.  Thus, $W_{n,3}$ is nonnegative on the closed unit interval. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B2</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ map the closed unit interval to itself, be continuous, nowhere decreasing, and subadditive, and equal 0 at 0. Then $W_{n,2}$ is nonnegative on the closed unit interval.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> The assumptions on $f$ imply that $B_n(f)\le 2 f$ (Li 2000)[^27], showing that $W_{n,2}$ is nonnegative on the closed unit interval.  &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A subadditive function $f$ has the property that $f(a+b) \le f(a)+f(b)$ whenever $a$, $b$, and $a+b$ are in $f$&#39;s domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proposition B3</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ map the closed unit interval to itself and have a Lipschitz continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant $L$.  If $f(\lambda) \ge \frac{L \lambda(1-\lambda)}{2m}$ on $f$&#39;s domain, for some $m\ge 1$, then $W_{n,2}$ is nonnegative there, for every $n\ge m$.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Let $E(\lambda, n) = \frac{L \lambda(1-\lambda)}{2n}$. Lorentz (1963)[^10] showed that with this Lipschitz derivative assumption on $f$, $B_n$ differs from $f(\lambda)$ by no more than $E(\lambda, n)$ for every $n\ge 1$ and wherever $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$.  As is well known, $B_n(0)=f(0)$ and $B_n(1)=f(1)$.  By inspection, $E(\lambda, n)$ is biggest when $n=1$ and decreases as $n$ increases. Assuming the worst case that $B_n(\lambda) = f(\lambda) + E(\lambda, m)$, it follows that $W_{n,2}=2 f(\lambda) - B_n(\lambda)\ge 2 f(\lambda) - f(\lambda) - E(\lambda, m) = f(\lambda) - E(\lambda, m)\ge 0$ whenever $f(\lambda)\ge E(\lambda, m)$.  Because $E(\lambda, k+1)\le E(\lambda,k)$ for every $k\ge 1$, the preceding sentence holds true for every $n\ge m$. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>The following results deal with a useful quantity when discussing the error in approximating a function by Bernstein polynomials.  Suppose a coin shows heads with probability $p$, and $n$ independent tosses of the coin are made.  Then the total number of heads $X$ follows a <em>binomial distribution</em>, and the $r$-th central moment of that distribution is as follows: $$T_{n,r}(p) = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^r] = \sum_{k=0}^n (k-np)^r{n \choose k}p^k (1-p)^{n-k},$$ where $\mathbb{E}[.]$ is the expected value (&quot;long-run average&quot;).   (Traditionally, another central moment, that of $X/n$ or the ratio of heads to tosses, is denoted $S_{n,r}(p)=T_{n,r}(p)/n^r=\mathbb{E}[(X/n-\mathbb{E}[X/n])^r]$.  $T$ and $S$ are notations of S.N. Bernstein, known for Bernstein polynomials.) The following results bound the absolute value of $T$ and $S$.[^28]</p>

<p><strong>Result B4</strong> (Molteni (2022)[^29]): If $r$ is an even integer such that $0\le r\le 44$, then for every integer $n\ge 1$, $|T_{n,r}(p)|\le (r!)/(((r/2)!)8^{r/2}) n^{r/2}$ and $|S_{n,r}(p)| \le (r!)/(((r/2)!)8^{r/2})\cdot(1/n^{r/2})$.</p>

<p><strong>Result B4A</strong> (Adell et al. (2015)[^30]):  For every odd integer $r\ge 1$, $T_{n,r}(p)$ is positive whenever $0\le p\lt 1/2$, and negative whenever $1/2\lt p\le 1$.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma B5</strong>: For every integer $n\ge 1$:</p>

<ul>
<li>$|S_{n,0}(p)|=1=1\cdot(p(1-p)/n)^{0/2}$.</li>
<li>$|S_{n,1}(p)|=0=0\cdot(p(1-p)/n)^{1/2}$.</li>
<li>$|S_{n,2}(p)|=p(1-p)/n=1\cdot(p(1-p)/n)^{2/2}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proof is straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Result B6</strong> (Adell and Cárdenas-Morales (2018)[^31]): Let $\sigma(r,t) = (r!)/(((r/2)!)t^{r/2})$.  If $r\ge 0$ is an even integer, then&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>for every integer $n\ge 1$, $|T_{n,r}(p)|\le \sigma(r,6)n^{r/2}$ and $|S_{n,r}(p)| \le \sigma(r,6)/n^{r/2}$, and</li>
<li>for every integer $n\ge 1$, $|T_{n,r}(1/2)|\le \sigma(r,8)n^{r/2}$ and $|S_{n,r}(1/2)| \le \sigma(r,8)/n^{r/2}$.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lemma B9</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Lipschitz continuous $r$-th derivative on the closed unit interval (see &quot;<a href="#Definitions"><strong>Definitions</strong></a>&quot;), where $r\ge 0$ is an integer, and let $M$ be equal to or greater than the $r$-th derivative&#39;s Lipschitz constant.  Denote $B_n(f)$ as the Bernstein polynomial of $f$ of degree $n$.  Then, for every $0\le x_0 \le 1$:</p>

<ol>
<li>$f$ can be written as $f(\lambda) = R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0) + f(x_0) + \sum_{i=1}^{r} (\lambda-x_0)^i f^{(i)}(x_0)/(i!)$ where $f^{(i)}$ is the $i$-th derivative of $f$.</li>
<li>If $r$ is odd, $|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le M/((((r+1)/2)!)(\beta n)^{(r+1)/2})$ for every integer $n\ge 1$, where $\beta$ is 8 if $r\le 43$ and 6 otherwise.</li>
<li>If $r=0$, $|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le M/(2n^{1/2})$ for every integer $n\ge 1$.</li>
<li>If $r$ is even and greater than 0, $|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!n^{(r+1)/2}}\left(\frac{2\cdot(r+1)!(r)!}{\gamma^{r+1}((r/2)!)^2}\right)^{1/2}$ for every integer $n\ge 2$, where $\gamma$ is 8 if $r\le 42$ and 6 otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof</em>: The well-known result of part 1 says $f$ equals the <em>Taylor polynomial</em> of degree $r$ at $x_0$ plus the <em>Lagrange remainder</em>,  $R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)$. A result found in Gonska et al. (2006)[^32], which applies for any integer $r\ge 0$, bounds that Lagrange remainder [^33].  By that result, because $f$&#39;s $r$-th derivative is Lipschitz continuous&mdash; $$|R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)|\le \frac{|\lambda-x_0|^r}{r!} M \frac{|\lambda-x_0|}{r+1}=M\frac{|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}}{(r+1)!}.$$</p>

<p>The goal is now to bound the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$.  This is easiest to do if $r$ is odd.</p>

<p>If $r$ is odd, then $(\lambda-x_0)^{r+1} = |\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$, so by Results B4 and B6, the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$ can be bounded as follows: $$|B_n((\lambda-x_0)^{r+1})(x_0)| \le \frac{(r+1)!}{(((r+1)/2)!)\beta^{(r+1)/2}}\frac{1}{n^{(r+1)/2}} = \sigma(r,n),$$ where $\beta$ is 8 if $r\le 43$ and 6 otherwise.  Therefore&mdash; $$|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!} |B_n((\lambda-x_0)^{r+1})(x_0)|$$ $$\le \frac{M}{(r+1)!}\frac{(r+1)!}{(((r+1)/2)!)\beta^{(r+1)/2}}\frac{1}{n^{(r+1)/2}} = \frac{M}{(((r+1)/2)!)(\beta n)^{(r+1)/2}}.$$</p>

<p>If $r$ is 0, then the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{1}$ is bounded by $\sqrt{x_0(1-x_0)/n}$ for every integer $n\ge 1$ (Cheng 1983)[^34], so&mdash; $$|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!}\sqrt{x_0(1-x_0)/n}\le \frac{M}{(r+1)!}\frac{1}{2n^{1/2}}=\frac{M}{2n^{1/2}}.$$</p>

<p>If $r$ is even and greater than 0, the Bernstein polynomial for $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$ can be bounded as follows for every $n\ge 2$, using <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchwarzsInequality.html"><strong>Schwarz&#39;s inequality</strong></a> (see also Bojanic and Shisha [1975][^35] for the case $r=4$): $$B_n(|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1})(x_0)=B_n((|\lambda-x_0|^{r/2}|\lambda-x_0|^{(r+2)/2})^2)(x_0)$$ $$\le\sqrt{|S_{n,r}(x_0)|}\sqrt{|S_{n,r+2}(x_0)|}\le\sqrt{\sigma(r,n)}\sqrt{\sigma(r+2,n)}$$ $$\le\frac{1}{n^{(r+1)/2}}\left(\frac{2\cdot(r+1)!(r)!}{\gamma^{r+1}((r/2)!)^2}\right)^{1/2},$$where $\gamma$ is 8 if $r\le 42$ and 6 otherwise. Therefore&mdash; $$|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!\cdot n^{(r+1)/2}}\left(\frac{2\cdot(r+1)!(r)!}{\gamma^{r+1}((r/2)!)^2}\right)^{1/2}. $$&#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If a function $f(\lambda)$ has a continuous $r$-th derivative on its domain (where $r\ge 0$ is an integer), then by Taylor&#39;s theorem for real variables, $R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)$, is writable as $f^{(r)}(c)\cdot (\lambda-x_0)^r /(r!),$ for some $c$ between $\lambda$ and $x_0$ (and thus on $f$&#39;s domain) (DLMF [^36] <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.4.E36"><strong>equation 1.4.36</strong></a>).  Thus, by this estimate, $|R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)| \le \frac{M}{r!} (\lambda-x_0)^r.$</li>
<li>It would be interesting to strengthen this lemma, at least for $r\le 10$, with a bound of the form $MC\cdot\max(1/n, (x_0(1-x_0)/n)^{1/2})^{r+1}$, where $C$ is an explicitly given constant depending on $r$, which is possible because the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$ can be bounded in this way (Lorentz 1966)[^9].</li>

<p><strong>Proposition B10</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Lipschitz continuous third derivative on the closed unit interval.  For each $n\ge 4$ that is divisible by 4, let $L_{3,n/4}(f) = (1/3)\cdot B_{n/4}(f) - 2\cdot B_{n/2}(f) + (8/3)\cdot B_{n}(f)$.  Then $L_{3,n/4}(f)$ is within $M/(8 n^2)$ of $f$, where $M$ is the maximum of the absolute value of that fourth derivative.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: This proof is inspired by the proof technique in Tachev (2022)[^5].</p>

<p>Because $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous third derivative, $f$ has the Lagrange remainder $R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0)$ given in Lemma B9 and Corollary B9A.</p>

<p>It is known that $L_{3,n/4}$ is a linear operator that preserves polynomials of degree 3 or less, so that $L_{3,n/4}(f) = f$ whenever $f$ is a polynomial of degree 3 or less (Ditzian and Totik 1987)[^37], Butzer (1955)[^6], May (1976)[^38].  Because of this, it can be assumed without loss of generality that $f(x_0)=0$.</p>

<p>Therefore&mdash;$$|L_{3,n/4}(f(\lambda))(x_0) - f(x_0)| = |L_{3,n/4}(R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0))|.$$ Now denote $\sigma_n$ as the maximum of $|B_n(R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)|$ over $0\le x_0\le 1$.  In turn (using Corollary B9A)&mdash; $$|L_{3,n/4}(R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0))| \le(1/3)\cdot\sigma_{n/4} + 2\cdot\sigma_{n/2}+(8/3)\cdot\sigma_n$$ $$\le (1/3)\frac{M}{128 (n/4)^2} + 2\frac{M}{128 (n/2)^2} + (8/3)\frac{M}{128 n^2} =M/(8 n^2).$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p>The proof of Proposition B10 shows how to prove an upper bound on the approximation error for polynomials written as&mdash; $$P(f)(x) = \alpha(n,0) B_{n(0)}(f)(x) + \alpha(n,1) B_{n(1)}(f)(x) + ... + \alpha(n,k) B_{n(k)}(f)(x)$$ (where $\alpha(n,i)$ is a function returning a real number, and $n(i)\ge 1$ is an integer), as long as $P$ preserves all polynomials of degree $r$ or less and $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous $r$-th derivative. An example is the polynomials $T_q^{(0)}$ described in Costabile et al. (1996)[^39].</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B10A:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Lipschitz continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval.  Let $Q_{n,2}(f)=B_n(f)(x)-\frac{x(1-x)}{2n} B_n(f&#39;&#39;)(x)$ be the <em>Lorentz operator</em> of order 2 (Holtz et al. 2011)[^7], (Lorentz 1966)[^9], which is a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree $n+2$.  Then if $n\ge 2$ is an integer, $Q_{n,2}(f)$ is within $\frac{M(\sqrt{3}+3)}{48 n^{3/2}} \lt 0.098585 M/(n^{3/2})$ of $f$, where $M$ is that second derivative&#39;s Lipschitz constant or greater.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Since $Q_{n,2}(f)$ preserves polynomials of degree 2 or less (Holtz et al. 2011, Lemma 14)[^7] and since $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous second derivative, $f$ has the Lagrange remainder $R_{f,2}(\lambda, x_0)$ given in Lemma B9, and $f&#39;&#39;$, the second derivative of $f$, has the Lagrange remainder $R_{f&#39;&#39;,0}(\lambda, x_0)$.  Thus, using Corollary B9A, the error bound can be written as&mdash; $$|Q_{n,2}(f(\lambda))(x_0) - f(x_0)|\le|B_n(R_{f,2}(\lambda, x_0))| + \frac{x_0(1-x_0)}{2n} |B_n(R_{f&#39;&#39;,0}(\lambda,x_0))|$$ $$\le \frac{\sqrt{3}M}{48 n^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{8n} \frac{M}{2 n^{1/2}} = \frac{M(\sqrt{3}+3)}{48 n^{3/2}} \lt 0.098585 M/(n^{3/2}).$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Corollary B10B:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval.  Then $B_n(f)$ is within $\frac{M}{8n}$ of $f$, where $M$ is the maximum of that second derivative&#39;s absolute value or greater.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Follows from Lorentz (1963)[^10] and the well-known fact that $M$ is an upper bound of $f$&#39;s first derivative&#39;s (minimal) Lipschitz constant. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>In the following propositions, $f^{(r)}$ means the $r$-th derivative of the function $f$ and $\max(|f|)$ means the maximum of the absolute value of the function $f$.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B10C:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Hölder continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval, with Hölder exponent $\alpha$ ($0\lt\alpha\le 1$) and Hölder constant $H_2$ or less.  Let $U_{n,2}(f)=B_n(2f-B_n(f))$ be $f$&#39;s iterated Boolean sum of order 2 of Bernstein polynomials.  Then if $n\ge 3$ is an integer, the error in approximating $f$ with $U_{n,2}(f)$ is as follows: $$|f-U_{n,2}(f)|\le \frac{M_2}{8 n^{2}} + 5 H_2/(32 n^{1+\alpha/2}) \le ((5H_2+4M_2)/32)/n^{1+\alpha/2},$$ where $M_2$ is the maximum of that second derivative&#39;s absolute value or greater.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: This proof is inspired by a result in Draganov (2004, Theorem 4.1)[^40].</p>

<p>The error to be bounded can be expressed as $|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|$.  Following Corollary B10B: $$|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|\le \frac{1}{8n} \max(|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}|).\tag{B10C-1}$$ It thus remains to estimate the right-hand side of the bound.  A result by Knoop and Pottinger (1976)[^23], which works for every $n\ge 3$, is what is known as a <em>simultaneous approximation</em> error bound, showing that the second derivative of the Bernstein polynomial approaches that of $f$ as $n$ increases.  Using this result: $$|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}| \le \frac{1}{n} M_2+(5/4) H_2/n^{\alpha/2},$$ so&mdash; $$|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|\le \frac{1}{8n} \left(\frac{1}{n} M_2+(5/4) H_2/n^{\alpha/2}\right)$$ $$\le \frac{M_2}{8 n^{2}} + \frac{5H_2}{32 n^{1+\alpha/2}}\le \frac{5H_2+4M_2}{32}\frac{1}{n^{1+\alpha/2}}.$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The error bound $0.75 M_2/n^2$ for $U_{n,2}$ is false in general if $f(\lambda)$ is assumed only to be non-negative, concave, and have a continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval.  A counterexample is $f(\lambda)=(1-(1-2\lambda)^{2.5})/2$ if $\lambda &lt;1/2$ and $(1-(2\lambda-1)^{2.5})/2$ otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proposition B10D:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Hölder continuous third derivative on the closed unit interval, with Hölder exponent $\alpha$ ($0\lt\alpha\le 1$) and Hölder constant $H_3$ or less.  If $n\ge 6$ is an integer, the error in approximating $f$ with $U_{n,2}(f)$ is as follows: $$|f-U_{n,2}(f)|\le \frac{\max(|f^{(2)}|)+\max(|f^{(3)}|)}{8n^2}+9H_3/(64 n^{(3+\alpha)/2})$$ $$\le \frac{9H_3+8\max(|f^{(2)}|)+8\max(|f^{(3)}|)}{64n^{(3+\alpha)/2}}.$$</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Again, the goal is to estimate the right-hand side of (B10C-1).  But this time, a different simultaneous approximation bound is employed, namely a result from Kacsó (2002)[^41], which in this case works if $n\ge\max(r+2,(r+1)r)=6$, where $r=2$. By that result: $$|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}| \le \frac{r(r-1)}{2n} M_2+\frac{r M_3}{2n}+\frac{9}{8}\omega_2(f^{(2)},1/n^{1/2})$$ $$\le \frac{1}{n} M_2+M_3/n+\frac{9}{8} H_3/n^{(1+\alpha)/2},$$ where $r=2$, $M_2 = \max(|f^{(2)}|)$, and $M_3=\max(|f^{(3)}|)$, using properties of $\omega_2$, the second-order modulus of continuity of $f^{(2)}$, given in Stancu et al. (2001)[^42].  Therefore&mdash; $$|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|\le \frac{1}{8n} \left(\frac{1}{n} M_2+M_3/n+\frac{9}{8} H_3/n^{(1+\alpha)/2}\right)$$ $$\le \frac{M_2+M_3}{8n^2} + \frac{9H_3}{64 n^{(3+\alpha)/2}}\le \frac{9H_3+8M_2+8M_3}{64n^{(3+\alpha)/2}}.$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p>In a similar way, it&#39;s possible to prove an error bound for $U_{n,3}$ that applies to functions with a Hölder continuous fourth or fifth derivative, by expressing the error bound as $|(B_n(f)-f)((B_n(f)-f)(B_n(f)-f))|$ and replacing the values for $M_2$, $M_3$, and $H_3$ in the bound proved at the end of Proposition B10D with upper bounds for $|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}|$, $|(B_n(f))^{(3)}-f^{(3)}|$, and $|(B_n(f))^{(4)}-f^{(4)}|$, respectively.</p>

<h3>Chebyshev Interpolants</h3>

<p>The following is a method that employs <em>Chebyshev interpolants</em> to compute the Bernstein coefficients of a polynomial that comes within $\epsilon$ of $f(\lambda)$, as long as $f$ meets certain conditions.  Because the method introduces a trigonometric function (the cosine function), it appears here in the appendix and it runs too slowly for real-time or &quot;online&quot; use; rather, this method is more suitable for pregenerating (&quot;offline&quot;) the approximate version of a function known in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li>$f$ must be continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and must have an $r$-th derivative of <em>bounded variation</em>, as described later.</li>
<li><p>Suppose $f$&#39;s domain is the interval $[a, b]$.  Then the <em>Chebyshev interpolant</em> of degree $n$ of $f$ (Wang 2023)[^43], (Trefethen 2013)[^44] is&mdash; $$p(\lambda)=\sum_{k=0}^n c_k T_k(2\frac{\lambda-a}{b-a}-1),$$ where&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>$c_k=\sigma(k,n)\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=0}^n \sigma(j,n) f(\gamma(j,n))T_k(\cos(j\pi/n))$,</li>
<li>$\gamma(j,n) = a+(b-a)(\cos(j\pi/n)+1)/2$,</li>
<li>$\sigma(k,n)$ is 1/2 if $k$ is 0 or $n$, and 1 otherwise, and</li>
<li>$T_k(x)$ is the $k$-th <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebyshevPolynomialoftheFirstKind.html"><strong>Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind</strong></a> (<code>chebyshevt(k,x)</code> in the SymPy computer algebra library).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let $r\ge 1$ and $n\gt r$ be integers. If $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $f$ has an $r$-th derivative of <em>bounded variation</em>, then the degree-$n$ Chebyshev interpolant of $f$ is within $\left(\frac{(b-a)}{2}\right)^r\frac{4V}{\pi r(n-r)^r}$ of $f$, where $V$ is the $r$-th derivative&#39;s <em>total variation</em> or greater.  This relies on a theorem in chapter 7 of Trefethen (2013)[^44] as well as a statement in note 1 at the end of this section.

<ul>
<li>If the $r$-th derivative is nowhere decreasing or nowhere increasing on the interval $[a, b]$, then $V$ can equal abs($f(b)-f(a)$).</li>
<li>If the $r$-th derivative is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $M$ or less, then $V$ can equal $M\cdot(b-a)$ (Kannan and Kreuger 1996)[^45].</li>
<li>The required degree is thus $n=\text{ceil}(r+\frac{(b-a)}{2}(4V/(\pi r\epsilon))^{1/r})$ &le; $\text{ceil}(r+\frac{(b-a)}{2}(1.2733 V/(r\epsilon))^{1/r})$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the desired error tolerance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If $f$ is real analytic on $[a, b]$, a better error bound is possible, but describing it requires ideas from complex analysis that are too advanced for this article.  See chapter 8 of Trefethen (2013)[^44].</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>Compute the required degree $n$ as given above, with error tolerance $\epsilon/2$.</li>
<li>Compute the ($n$ plus one) coefficients of $f$&#39;s degree-$n$ Chebyshev interpolant, call them $c_0, ..., c_n$.</li>
<li>Compute the (<em>n</em>+1)&times;(<em>n</em>+1) matrix $M$ described in Theorem 1 of Rababah (2003)[^46].</li>
<li>Multiply the matrix by the transposed coefficients $(c_0, ..., c_n)$ to get the polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficients $b_0, ..., b_n$.  (Transposing means turning columns to rows and vice versa.)</li>
<li>For each $i$, replace the Bernstein coefficient $b_i$ with $\text{floor}(b_i / (\epsilon/2) + 1/2) \cdot (\epsilon/2)$.</li>
<li>Return the Bernstein coefficients $b_0, ..., b_n$.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The following statement can be shown.  Let $f(x)$ be continuous on the interval $[a, b]$.  If the $r$-th derivative of $f$, call it $FR$, has total variation $V$, where $r\ge 1$, then $g(x) = FR(a+(b-a) (x+1)/2)$ has total variation $V\left(\frac{b-a}{2}\right)^r$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$.</li>
<li>The method in this section doesn&#39;t require $f(\lambda)$ to have a particular minimum or maximum.  If $f$ must map the closed unit interval to itself and the Bernstein coefficients must lie on that interval, the following changes to the method are needed:

<ul>
<li>$f(\lambda)$ must be continuous on the closed unit interval ($a=0$, $b=1$) and take on only values in that interval.</li>
<li>If any Bernstein coefficient returned by the method is less than 0 or greater than 1, double the value of $n$ and repeat the method starting at step 2 until that condition is no longer true.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It would be of interest to build Chebyshev-like interpolants that sample $f(\lambda)$ at <em>rational</em> values of $\lambda$ that get closer to the Chebyshev points (e.g., $\cos(j\pi/n)$) with increasing $n$, and to find results that provide explicit bounds (with no hidden constants) on the approximation error that are close to those for Chebyshev interpolants.</li>
