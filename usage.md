## To Improve English Usage Through Word Processing Apps...

What I would like to see is an open-source plugin for popular word-processing applications that finds overused and discouraged words and phrases in a document, such as those mentioned above, and suggests replacements such as those made above.  (A similar practice is found in Web browsers' spell checkers.)  For example, the plugin could look for instances of "sit down with", underline them, and show suggestions such as "interview", "consult with", and so on in a menu when the phrase is right-clicked on.
