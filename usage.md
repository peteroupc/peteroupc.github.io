# Overused and Discouraged Words and Phrases

To improve English usage, reduce monotony, and enrich English vocabulary in writing and speech, I have compiled these two lists on what not to say and what to say better.  Many items in these tables were inspired by Emilio Bernal Labrada, "Good usage prevents abusage", 2018.

The lists could also be useful as a handout to Literacy students from ninth grade and up, or to suggest alternatives to overused and discouraged words for younger students.  For my other suggestions on Literacy instruction, see "[**Suggestions for Instructional Materials**](https://peteroupc.github.io/insmat.html)".

Emilio Bernal, in "Good usage prevents abusage", wrote of his concerns about, among other things, the overuse of _people_, _persons_, _members_, _day_, and _happen_, as well as the unnecessary repetition of words (e.g., _He is someone who is reliable_; _She wants what she wants_; _It'll happen when it'll happen_).  His work formed the basis of many of the suggestions in the following table.

## To Improve English Usage Through Word Processing Apps...

What I would like to see is an open-source plugin for popular word-processing applications that finds overused and discouraged words and phrases in a document, such as those mentioned above, and suggests corresponding replacements.  (A similar practice is found in Web browsers' spell checkers.)  For example, the plugin could look for instances of "sit down with", underline them, and show suggestions such as "interview", "consult with", and so on in a menu when the phrase is right-clicked on.
