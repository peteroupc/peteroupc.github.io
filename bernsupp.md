## Definitions

This section describes certain math terms used on this page for programmers to understand.

The _closed unit interval_ (written as \[0, 1\]) means the set consisting of 0, 1, and every real number in between.

The following terms can describe a function $f(x)$, specifically how "well-behaved" $f$ is.

- A _continuous_ function $f$ has the property that there is a function $h(x, \epsilon)$ (where $x$ is in $f$'s domain and $\epsilon>0$), such that $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are less than $\epsilon$ apart whenever $x$ and $y$ are in $f$'s domain and less than $h(x, \epsilon)$ apart.<br>Roughly speaking, for each $x$ in $f$'s domain, $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are "close" if $x$ and $y$ are "close" and belong in the domain.
- If $f$ is continuous, its _derivative_ is, roughly speaking, its "slope" function or "velocity" function or "instantaneous-rate-of-change" function.  The derivative (or _first derivative_) is denoted $f'$ or $f^{(1)}$.  The _second derivative_ ("slope-of-slope") of $f$, denoted $f''$ or $f^{(2)}$, is the derivative of $f'$; the _third derivative_, denoted $f^{(3)}$, is the derivative of $f''$; and so on.  The _0-th derivative_ of a function $f$ is $f$ itself and denoted $f^{(0)}$.
- A [**_Hölder continuous_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hölder_condition) function  (with _M_ being the _Hölder constant_ and _&alpha;_ being the _Hölder exponent_) is a continuous function _f_ such that _f_(_x_) and _f_(_y_) are no more than _M_\*_&delta;_<sup>_&alpha;_</sup> apart whenever _x_ and _y_ are in the function's domain and no more than _&delta;_ apart.<br>Here, _&alpha;_ satisfies 0 &lt; _&alpha;_ &le; 1.<br>Roughly speaking, the function's "steepness" is no greater than that of _M_\*_x_<sup>_&alpha;_</sup>.
- A _Lipschitz continuous_ function with constant _L_ (the _Lipschitz constant_) is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent 1 and Hölder constant _L_.<br>Roughly speaking, the function's "steepness" is no greater than that of _L_\*_x_.<br>If the function has a derivative on its domain, _L_ can be the maximum of the absolute value of that derivative.
- A _convex_ function $f$ has the property that $f((x+y)/2) \le (f(x)+f(y))/2$ whenever $x$, $y$, and $(x+y)/2$ are in the function's domain.<br>Roughly speaking, if the function's "slope" never goes down, then it's convex.
- A _concave_ function $f$ has the property that $f((x+y)/2) \ge (f(x)+f(y))/2$ whenever $x$, $y$, and $(x+y)/2$ are in the function's domain.<br>Roughly speaking, if the function's "slope" never goes up, then it's concave.
- The function $f$ is _bounded_ if there are two numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a\le f(x)\le b$ whenever $x$ is in the function's domain.

> **Note**: The "good behavior" of a function can be important when designing Bernoulli factory algorithms.  This page mostly cares how $f$ behaves when its domain is the closed unit interval, that is, when $0 \le x \le 1$.

## General Factory Functions

As a reminder, the _Bernoulli factory problem_ is: Suppose there is a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability, _&lambda;_, and the goal is to use that coin (and possibly also a fair coin) to build a "new" coin that shows heads with a probability that depends on _&lambda;_, call it _f_(_&lambda;_).

The algorithm for [**general factory functions**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions), described in my main article on Bernoulli factory algorithms, works by building randomized upper and lower bounds for a function _f_(_&lambda;_), based on flips of the input coin.  Roughly speaking, the algorithm works as follows:

1. Generate a random variate, _U_, uniformly distributed, greater than 0 and less than 1.
2. Flip the input coin, then build an upper and lower bound for _f_(_&lambda;_), based on the outcomes of the flips so far.
3. If _U_ is less than or equal to the lower bound, return 1. If _U_ is greater than the upper bound, return 0.  Otherwise, go to step 2.

These randomized upper and lower bounds come from two sequences of polynomials as follows:

1. One sequence approaches the function _f_(_&lambda;_) from above, the other from below, and both sequences must converge to _f_.
2. For each sequence, the first polynomial has degree 1 (so is a linear function), and each other polynomial's degree is 1 higher than the previous.
3. The _consistency requirement_ must be met, namely&mdash;
    - the difference between the degree-(_n_&minus;1) upper polynomial and the degree-_n_ upper polynomial, and
    - the difference between the degree-_n_ lower polynomial and the degree-(_n_&minus;1) lower polynomial,

    must have nonnegative Bernstein coefficients, once each of these differences is rewritten as a polynomial of degree exactly _n_.  (For more on Bernstein coefficients and the Bernstein form of polynomials, see "[**Certain Polynomials**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Certain_Polynomials)" in the main article.)

The consistency requirement ensures that the upper polynomials "decrease" and the lower polynomials "increase".  Unfortunately, the reverse is not true in general; even if the upper polynomials "decrease" and the lower polynomials "increase" to _f_, this does not ensure the consistency requirement by itself.

> **Example (Nacu & Peres [2005][^1]):** The polynomial $x^2+(1-x)^2$ is of degree 2 with Bernstein coefficients [1, 0, 1].  The polynomial $x(1-x)$ is of degree 2 with Bernstein coefficients [0, 1/2, 0]. Although $(x^2+(1-x)^2)$ minus $(x(1-x))$ is nonnegative, this difference's Bernstein coefficients of degree 2 are not always nonnegative, namely, the Bernstein coefficients are [1, -1/2, 1].

In this document, **fbelow**(_n_, _k_) and **fabove**(_n_, _k_) mean the _k_<sup>th</sup> Bernstein coefficient for the lower or upper degree-_n_ polynomial, respectively, where 0 &le; _k_ &le; _n_ is an integer.

The section "Building the Lower and Upper Polynomials" are ways to build sequences of polynomials that appropriately converge to a factory function if that function meets certain conditions.

To determine if the methods are right for _f_(_&lambda;_), a deep mathematical analysis of _f_ is required; it would be helpful to plot that function using a computer algebra system to see if it is described in the next section.

<a id=Building_the_Lower_and_Upper_Polynomials></a>

### Building the Lower and Upper Polynomials

The rest of this section assumes _f_(_&lambda;_) is not a constant.  For examples of functions, see "[**Examples of Well-Behaved Functions**](#Examples_of_Well_Behaved_Functions)", in the appendix.

**Concave functions.** If _f_ is concave, then **fbelow**(_n_, _k_) can equal _f_(_k_/_n_), thanks to Jensen's inequality.

**Convex functions.** If _f_ is convex, then **fabove**(_n_, _k_) can equal _f_(_k_/_n_), thanks to Jensen's inequality.

**Hölder and Lipschitz continuous functions.** I have found a way to extend the results of Nacu and Peres (2005\)[^1] to certain functions with a slope that tends to a vertical slope.  The following scheme, proved in the appendix, implements **fabove** and **fbelow** if _f_(_&lambda;_)&mdash;

- is [**_Hölder continuous_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hölder_condition) on the closed unit interval, with Hölder constant _m_ or less and Hölder exponent _&alpha;_ (see "[**Definitions**](#Definitions)" as well as "[**Examples of Well-Behaved Functions**](#Examples_of_Well_Behaved_Functions)", in the appendix), and
- on the closed unit interval&mdash;
    - has a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1, or
    - is convex and has a minimum of greater than 0, or
    - is concave and has a maximum of less than 1.

For every integer _n_ that's a power of 2:

- _D_(_n_) = _m_\*(2/7)<sup>_&alpha;_/2</sup>/((2<sup>_&alpha;_/2</sup>&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>_&alpha;_/2</sup>).
- **fbelow**(_n_, _k_) = _f_(_k_/_n_) if _f_ is concave; otherwise, min(**fbelow**(4,0), **fbelow**(4,1), ..., **fbelow**(4,4)) if _n_ < 4; otherwise, _f_(_k_/_n_) &minus; _D_(_n_).
- **fabove**(_n_, _k_) = _f_(_k_/_n_) if _f_ is convex; otherwise, max(**fabove**(4,0), **fabove**(4,1), ..., **fabove**(4,4)) if _n_ < 4; otherwise, _f_(_k_/_n_) + _D_(_n_).

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. If _&alpha;_ is 1, _D_(_n_) can be _m_\*322613/(250000\*sqrt(_n_)), which is an upper bound.  If _&alpha;_ is 1/2, _D_(_n_) can be _m_\*154563/(40000\*_n_<sup>1/4</sup>), which is an upper bound.
> 2. The function $f(x)=\min(\lambda t, 1-\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon\ge 0$ and $t\ge 1$, is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant _t_.  Because $f$ is linear between 0 and 1/_t_, ways to build polynomials that converge to this kind of function were discussed by Thomas and Blanchet (2012)[^2] [^3] and Nacu & Peres (2005)[^1] [^4].

**Functions with a Lipschitz continuous derivative.** The following method, proved in the appendix, implements **fabove** and **fbelow** if _f_(_&lambda;_)&mdash;

- has a Lipschitz continuous derivative (see "[**Definitions**](#Definitions)" as well as "[**Examples of Well-Behaved Functions**](#Examples_of_Well_Behaved_Functions)", in the appendix), and
- in the closed unit interval&mdash;
    - has a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1, or
    - is convex and has a minimum of greater than 0, or
    - is concave and has a maximum of less than 1.

Let _m_ be the Lipschitz constant of _f_'s derivative, or a greater number than that constant.  Then for every integer _n_ that's a power of 2:

- For every $n$ such that **fbelow**(_n_,_k_) is 0 or greater for every _k_, **fbelow**(_n_, _k_) = _f_(_k_/_n_) if _f_ is concave; otherwise, min(**fbelow**(4,0), **fbelow**(4,1), ..., **fbelow**(4,4)) if _n_ < 4; otherwise,  _f_(_k_/_n_) &minus; _m_/(7\*_n_).  For every other $n$, **fbelow**(_n_,_k_) = 0.
- For every $n$ such that **fabove**(_n_,_k_) is 1 or less for every _k_, **fabove**(_n_, _k_) = _f_(_k_/_n_) if _f_ is convex; otherwise, max(**fabove**(4,0), **fabove**(4,1), ..., **fabove**(4,4)) if _n_ < 4; otherwise, _f_(_k_/_n_) + _m_/(7\*_n_).  For every other $n$, **fabove**(_n_,_k_) = 1.

**Certain functions that equal 0 at 0.** This approach involves transforming the function _f_ so that it no longer equals 0 at the point 0.  This can be done by dividing _f_ by a function (`High`(_&lambda;_)) that "dominates" _f_ everywhere on the closed unit interval.  Unlike for the original function, there might be a polynomial-building scheme described earlier in this section for the transformed function.

More specifically, `High`(_&lambda;_) must meet the following requirements:

- `High`(_&lambda;_) is continuous on the closed unit interval.
- `High`(0) = 0. (This is required to ensure correctness in case _&lambda;_ is 0.)
- 1 &ge; `High`(1) &ge; _f_(1) &ge; 0.
- 1 &gt; `High`(_&lambda;_) &gt; _f_(_&lambda;_) &gt; 0 whenever 0 < _&lambda;_ < 1.
- If _f_(1) = 0, then `High`(1) = 0. (This is required to ensure correctness in case _&lambda;_ is 1.)

Also, `High` is a Bernoulli factory function that should admit a simple Bernoulli factory algorithm.  For example, `High` can be the following degree-_n_ polynomial: 1&minus;(1&minus;_&lambda;_)<sup>_n_</sup>, where _n_&ge;1 is an integer.[^5]

The algorithm is now described.

Let _g_(_&lambda;_) = lim<sub>_&nu;_&rarr;_&lambda;_</sub> _f_(_&nu;_)/`High`(_&nu;_) (roughly speaking, the value that _f_(_&nu;_)/`High`(_&nu;_) approaches as _&nu;_ approaches _&lambda;_.) If&mdash;

- _f_(0) = 0 and _f_(1) < 1, and
- _g_(_&lambda;_) is continuous on the closed unit interval and belongs in one of the classes of functions given earlier,

then _f_ can be simulated using the following algorithm:

1. Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for `High`.  If the call returns 0, return 0. (For example, if `High`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_, then this step amounts to the following: "Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.")
2. Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _g_(.) and return the result of that algorithm.  This can be one of the [**general factory function algorithms**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions) if there is a way to calculate polynomials that converge to _g_(.) in a manner needed for that algorithm (for example, if _g_ is described earlier in this section).

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. It may happen that _g_(0) = 0.  In this case, step 2 of this algorithm can involve running this algorithm again, but with new _g_ and `High` functions that are found based on the current _g_ function. (This will eventually result in _g_(0) being nonzero if _f_ is a nonconstant Bernoulli factory function.)   See the second example below.
> 2. `High`(_&lambda;_) can also equal 1 instead of be described in this section.  That leads to the original Bernoulli factory algorithm for _f_(_&lambda;_).
>
> **Examples:**
>
> 1. If _f_(_&lambda;_) = (sinh(_&lambda;_)+cosh(_&lambda;_)&minus;1)/4, then _f_ is less than or equal to `High`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_, so _g_(_&lambda;_) is 1/4 if _&lambda;_ = 0, and (exp(_&lambda;_) &minus; 1)/(4\*_&lambda;_) otherwise.  The following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library computes this example: `fx = (sinh(x)+cosh(x)-1)/4; h = x; pprint(Piecewise((limit(fx/h,x,0), Eq(x,0)), ((fx/h).simplify(), True)))`.
> 2. If _f_(_&lambda;_) = cosh(_&lambda;_) &minus; 1, then _f_ is less than or equal to `High`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_, so _g_(_&lambda;_) is 0 if _&lambda;_ = 0, and (cosh(_&lambda;_)&minus;1)/_&lambda;_ otherwise.  Now, since _g_(0) = 0, find new functions _g_ and `High` based on the current _g_.  The current _g_ is less than or equal to `High`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_\*3\*(2&minus;_&lambda;_)/5 (a degree-2 polynomial that has Bernstein coefficients [0, 6/10, 6/10]), so _G_(_&lambda;_) = 5/12 if _&lambda;_ = 0, and &minus;(5\*cosh(_&lambda;_) &minus; 5)/(3\*_&lambda;_<sup>2</sup>\*(_&lambda;_&minus;2)) otherwise. _G_ is bounded away from 0 and 1, resulting in the following algorithm:
>
>     1. (Simulate `High`.) Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.
>     2. (Simulate `High`.) Flip the input coin twice.  If both flips return 0, return 0.  Otherwise, with probability 4/10 (that is, 1 minus 6/10), return 0.
>     3. Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _G_ (which might involve building polynomials that converge to _G_, noticing that _G_'s derivative is Lipschitz continuous) and return the result of that algorithm.

**Certain functions that equal 0 at 0 and 1 at 1.**  Let _f_, _g_, and `High` be functions as defined earlier, except that _f_(0) = 0 and _f_(1) = 1.  Define the following additional functions:

- `Low`(_&lambda;_) is a function that meets the following requirements:
    - `Low`(_&lambda;_) is continuous on the closed unit interval.
    - `Low`(0) = 0 and `Low`(1) = 1.
    - 1 &gt; _f_(_&lambda;_) &gt; `Low`(_&lambda;_) &gt; 0 whenever 0 < _&lambda;_ < 1.
- _q_(_&lambda;_) = lim<sub>_&nu;_&rarr;_&lambda;_</sub> `Low`(_&nu;_)/`High`(_&nu;_).
- _r_(_&lambda;_) = lim<sub>_&nu;_&rarr;_&lambda;_</sub> (1&minus;_g_(_&nu;_))/(1&minus;_q_(_&nu;_)).

Roughly speaking, `Low` is a function that bounds _f_ from below, just as `High` bounds _f_ from above. `Low` is a Bernoulli factory function that should admit a simple Bernoulli factory algorithm; one example is the polynomial _&lambda;_<sup>_n_</sup> where _n_&ge;1 is an integer.  If both `Low` and `High` are polynomials of the same degree, _q_ will be a ratio of polynomials with a relatively simple Bernoulli factory algorithm (see "[**Certain Rational Functions**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Certain_Rational_Functions)").

Now, if _r_(_&lambda;_) is continuous on the closed unit interval, then _f_ can be simulated using the following algorithm:

1. Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for `High`.  If the call returns 0, return 0. (For example, if `High`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_, then this step amounts to the following: "Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.")
2. Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _q_(.).  If the call returns 1, return 1.
3. Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _r_(.), and return 1 minus the result of that call.  The Bernoulli factory algorithm can be one of the [**general factory function algorithms**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions) if there is a way to calculate polynomials that converge to _r_(.) in a manner needed for that algorithm (for example, if _r_ is described earlier in this section).

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. Quick proof: Rewrite $f=\text{High}\cdot(q\cdot1+(1-q)\cdot(1-r))+(1-\text{High})\cdot0$.
> 2. `High`(_&lambda;_) is allowed to equal 1 if the _r_(.) in step 3 is allowed to equal 0 at 0.
>
> **Example:** If _f_(_&lambda;_) = (1&minus;exp(_&lambda;_))/(1&minus;exp(1)), then _f_ is less than or equal to `High`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_, and greater than or equal to `Low`(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_<sup>2</sup>.  As a result, _q_(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_, and _r_(_&lambda;_) = (2 &minus; exp(1))/(1 &minus; exp(1)) if _&lambda;_ = 0; 1/(exp(1)&minus;1) if _&lambda;_ = 1; and (&minus;_&lambda;_\*(1 &minus; exp(1)) &minus; exp(_&lambda;_) + 1)/(_&lambda;_\*(1 &minus; exp(1))\*(_&lambda;_ &minus; 1)) otherwise.  This can be computed using the following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library: `fx=(1-exp(x))/(1-exp(1)); high=x; low=x**2; q=(low/high); r=(1-fx/high)/(1-q); r=Piecewise((limit(r, x, 0), Eq(x,0)), (limit(r,x,1),Eq(x,1)), (r,True)).simplify(); pprint(r)`.

**Other functions that equal 0 or 1 at the endpoint 0, 1, or both.** The table below accounts for these Bernoulli factory functions:

| If _f_(0) = | And _f_(1) = |      Method |
 -- | -- | -------- |

### Another General Algorithm

The algorithm I've developed in this section simulates $f(\lambda)$ when $f$ belongs in a large class of functions, as long as the following is known:

- $f$ is continuous and has a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1.
- There is a family of polynomials ($L_{1}(f)$, $L_{2}(f)$, $L_{4}(f)$, $L_{8}(f)$, ...) that come close to $f$ with a known error bound, where the number after $L$ is the degree of the polynomial.
- There is a way to find the _Bernstein coefficients_ of each polynomial $L_{n}(f)$ in the family of polynomials.

For examples of suitable polynomials, see [**"Approximations in Bernstein Form"**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernapprox.html).

In effect, the algorithm writes $f$ as an infinite sum of polynomials, whose maximums must sum to 1 or less (called _T_ in the algorithm below), then simulates an appropriate [**convex combination**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Convex_Combinations) (weighted sum) of these polynomials.  To build the convex combination, each polynomial in the infinite sum is divided by an upper bound on its maximum (which is why error bounds on $L_{n}(f)$ are crucial here).[^6] To simulate $f$, the algorithm&mdash;

- selects a polynomial in the convex combination with probability proportional to its upper bound, or a "leftover" zero polynomial with probability _T_, then
- simulates the chosen polynomial (which is easy to do; see Goyal and Sigman (2012)[^7]).

--------------

- In the algorithm, denote:
    - $\epsilon(f, n)$ as an upper bound on the absolute value of the difference between $f$ and the degree-$n$ polynomial $L_{n}(f)$. $\epsilon(f, n)$ must increase nowhere as $n$ increases, and must converge to 0.
        - For best results, this should be written as $\epsilon(f, n) = C/n^r$, where $C$ is a constant and $r>0$ is a multiple of 1/2, since then it's easy to find the value of ErrShift(f, n), later.  In this case, the algorithm should be limited to functions with a continuous $(2r)$-th derivative or a Lipschitz continuous $(2r-1)$-th derivative (see "[**Achievable Simulation Rates**](#Achievable_Simulation_Rates)", later).  (For example, if the error bound is $C/n^2$, the function $f$ should have a continuous fourth derivative or a Lipschitz continuous third derivative.)
        - For examples of error bounds, see [**"Approximations in Bernstein Form"**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernapprox.html).
    - ErrShift($f, m$) as 1.01 $\cdot\sum_{i\ge m} \epsilon(f, 2^i)$.  The factor 1.01 is needed to ensure each difference polynomial is strictly between 0 and 1.
        - **Example:** If $\epsilon(f, n) = C/n^r$, then ErrShift($f, m)$ = $1.01\cdot C\cdot 2^r/(((2^r)-1)\cdot 2^{rm})$.
    - DiffWidth($f, m$) as 1.01 $\cdot 2 (\epsilon(f, 2^m)$ + $\epsilon(f, 2^{m+1}))$.  This is an upper bound on the maximum difference between the shifted degree-$2^m$ and the shifted degree-$(2^{m+1})$ polynomial.
- The technique breaks $f$ into a **starting polynomial** and a family of **difference polynomials**.<br>To find the **starting polynomial**:
    1. Set $m$ to 0.
    2. Find the Bernstein coefficients of $L_{2^m}$, then subtract ErrShift($f, m$) from them.  If those coefficients now all lie in the closed unit interval, go to the next step.  Otherwise, add 1 to _m_ and repeat this step.
    3. Calculate **StartWidth** as ceil($c\cdot 65536$)/65536, where $c$ is the maximum Bernstein coefficient from step 2, then divide each Bernstein coefficient by **StartWidth**. (65536 is arbitrary and ensures **StartWidth** is a rational number that is close to, but no lower than, the maximum Bernstein coefficient, for convenience.)
    4. The **starting polynomial** now has Bernstein coefficients found in step 3.  Set **StartOrder** to _m_.
- To find the **difference polynomial** of order $m$:
    1. Find the Bernstein coefficients of $L_{2^m}$, then subtract ErrShift($f, m$) from them.  Rewrite them to Bernstein coefficients of degree $2^{m+1}$.  Call the coefficients **LowerCoeffs**.
    2. Find the Bernstein coefficients of $L_{2^{m+1}}$, then subtract ErrShift($f, m+1$) from them.  Call the resulting values **UpperCoeffs**.
    3. Subtract **UpperCoeffs** from **LowerCoeffs**, and call the result **DiffCoeffs**.  Divide each coefficient in **DiffCoeffs** by DiffWidth($f, m$).  The result is the Bernstein coefficients of a positive polynomial of degree $2^{m+1}$ bounded by 0 and 1, but these coefficients are not necessarily bounded by 0 and 1.  Thus, if any coefficient in **DiffCoeffs** is less than 0 or greater than 1, add 1 to _m_ and rewrite **DiffCoeffs** to Bernstein coefficients of degree $2^{m+1}$ until no coefficient is less than 0 or greater than 1 anymore.
    4. The **difference polynomial** now has Bernstein coefficients given by **DiffCoeffs**.
- The probabilities for _X_ are as follows:
    - First, find the **starting polynomial**, then calculate _T_ as **StartWidth** + $\sum_{i\ge 0}$ DiffWidth($f$, **StartOrder**+_i_).  If _T_ is greater than 1, this algorithm can't be used.
        - **Example:** If $\epsilon(f, n) = C/n^r$, then _T_ = **StartWidth** + 1.01 $\cdot(2 \cdot 2^{-r\cdot\text{StartOrder}} C (1 + 2^{- r}))/(1 - 2^{- r})$.
    - _X_ is 0 with probability 1 &minus; _T_.
    - _X_ is 1 with probability equal to **StartWidth**.
    - For each _m_ &ge; 2, _X_ is _m_ with probability equal to DiffWidth($f$,**StartOrder** + _m_ &minus; 2).

Then an algorithm to toss heads with probability equal to $f$ would be:

1. Generate _X_ at random with the probabilities given earlier.
2. If _X_ is 0, return 0.  Otherwise, if _X_ is 1, find the **starting polynomial** and its Bernstein coefficients.  Otherwise (if _X_ is 2 or greater), find the **difference polynomial** of order _m_ and its Bernstein coefficients, where _m_ = (_X_&minus;2) + **StartOrder**.
3. Flip the input coin (with probability of heads $\lambda$), $n - 1$ times, where $n$ is the number of Bernstein coefficients in the polynomial found in step 2 (its degree plus one), and let $j$ be the number of heads.
4. Return 1 with probability equal to the polynomial's $j$th Bernstein coefficient ($j$ starts at 0), or 0 otherwise (see also Goyal and Sigman 2012 for an algorithm to simulate polynomials).

If _T_ turns out to be greater than 1 in this algorithm, but still finite, one way to simulate $f$ is to create a coin that simulates $f(\lambda)/T$ instead, and use that coin as the input to a [**_linear Bernoulli factory_**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Linear_Bernoulli_Factories) that simulates $T\cdot (f(\lambda)/T)$.  (This is possible especially because $f(\lambda)$ is assumed to have a maximum of less than 1.)

> **Example**: The following parameters allow this algorithm to work if $f$ is concave, has a maximum of less than 1, and has a Lipschitz-continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant _M_ or less.  In this case, it is allowed that $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=0$, or both.
>
> - The family of polynomials $L_n(f)$ is simply the family of Bernstein polynomials of $f$.  The Bernstein coefficients of $L_n(f)$ are $f(0/n), f(1/n), ..., f(n/n)$.
> - The error bound is $\epsilon(f, n) = M/(8n)$ (Lorentz 1963)[^8].
> - The **starting polynomial** is found as follows. Let _c_ = max($f(0), f(1)$).  Then the starting polynomial has two Bernstein coefficients both equal to $c$; **StartWidth** is equal to ceil($c\cdot 65536$)/65536, and **StartOrder** is equal to 0.
> - ErrShift($f,m$) = 0. The reason for 0 is that $f$ is concave, so its Bernstein polynomials naturally "increase" with increasing degree (Temple 1954)[^9], (Moldovan 1962)[^10].
> - DiffWidth($f,m$) = $1.01\cdot 3 M/(8\cdot 2^m)$.  For the same reason as the previous point, and because the Bernstein polynomials are always "below" $f$, DiffWidth($f,m$) can also equal 1.01 $\cdot \epsilon(f, 2^{m})$ = $1.01\cdot M/(8\cdot 2^m)$.  This is what is used to calculate _T_, later.
> - _T_ is calculated as **StartWidth** + $1.01\cdot M/4$.

### Request for Additional Methods

Readers are requested to let me know of additional solutions to the following problem:

_Let $f(\lambda)$ be continuous and satisfy $0\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1$ whenever $0\le\lambda\le 1$.  Given that $f(\lambda)$ belongs to a large class of functions (for example, it has a continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, or nowhere decreasing $k$-th derivative for some integer $k$, or any combination of these), compute the Bernstein coefficients for two sequences of polynomials as follows: one of them approaches $f(\lambda)$ from above, the other from below, and the consistency requirement must be met (see "[**General Factory Functions**](#General_Factory_Functions)")._

_The polynomials need to be computed only for degrees 2, 4, 8, 16, and higher powers of 2._

_The rate of convergence must be no slower than $1/n^{r/2}$ if the given class has only functions with continuous $r$-th derivative._

_Methods that use only integer arithmetic and addition and multiplication of rational numbers are preferred (thus, methods that involve cosines, sines, $\pi$, $\exp$, and $\ln$ are not preferred)._

<a id=Approximate_Bernoulli_Factories></a>

## Approximate Bernoulli Factories

An **approximate Bernoulli factory** for a function _f_(_&lambda;_) is a Bernoulli factory algorithm that simulates another function, _g_(_&lambda;_), that approximates _f_ in some sense.

Usually _g_ is a polynomial, but can also be a rational function (ratio of polynomials) or another function with an easy-to-implement Bernoulli factory algorithm.

Meanwhile, _f_(_&lambda;_) can be any function that maps the closed unit interval to itself, even if it isn't continuous or a factory function (examples include the "step function" 0 if _&lambda;_ < 1/2 and 1 otherwise, or the function 2\*min(_&lambda;_, 1 &minus; _&lambda;_)).  If the function is continuous, it can be approximated arbitrarily well by an approximate Bernoulli factory (as a result of the so-called "Weierstrass approximation theorem"), but generally not if the function is discontinuous.

To build an approximate Bernoulli factory with a polynomial:

1. First, find a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree _n_ that is close enough to the desired function _f_(_&lambda;_).

    The simplest choice for this polynomial, known simply as a _Bernstein polynomial_, has _n_+1 Bernstein coefficients and its _j_<sup>th</sup> coefficient (starting at 0) is found as _f_(_j_/_n_).  For this choice, if _f_ is continuous, the polynomial can be brought arbitrarily close to _f_ by choosing _n_ high enough.

    Other choices for this polynomial are given in the page [**"Approximations in Bernstein Form"**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernapprox.html).

    Whatever polynomial is used, the polynomial's Bernstein coefficients must all lie on the closed unit interval.

    The polynomial can be in _homogeneous form_ (also known as _scaled Bernstein_ form (Farouki and Rajan 1988)[^11]) instead of in Bernstein form, with _scaled Bernstein coefficients_ $s_0, ..., s_n$, as long as $0\le s_i\le{n\choose i}$ where $0\le i\le n$.

2. The rest of the process is to toss heads with probability equal to that polynomial, given its Bernstein coefficients.  To do this, first flip the input coin _n_ times, and let _j_ be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way.

3. Then, with probability equal to&mdash;

    - the polynomial's Bernstein coefficient at position _j_ (which will be $f(j/n)$ in the case of the Bernstein polynomial $B_n(f)$), or
    - the polynomial's scaled Bernstein coefficient at position _j_, divided by choose(_n_, _j_),

    return 1.  Otherwise, return 0. Here, 0&le;_j_&le;_n_.

    If the probability can be an irrational number, see "[**Algorithms for General Irrational Constants**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Algorithms_for_General_Irrational_Constants)" for ways to exactly sample a probability equal to that irrational number.

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. More sophisticated ways to implement steps 2 and 3 are found in the section "[**Certain Polynomials**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html)" in the main article "Bernoulli Factory Algorithms".
> 2. There are other kinds of functions, besides polynomials and rational functions, that serve to approximate continuous functions.  But many of them work poorly as approximate Bernoulli factory functions because their lack of "smoothness" means there is no simple Bernoulli factory for them.  For example, a _spline_, which is a continuous function made up of a finite number of polynomial pieces, is generally not "smooth" at the points where the spline's pieces meet.
> 3. Bias and variance are the two sources of error in a randomized estimation algorithm.  Let _g_(_&lambda;_) be an approximation of _f_(_&lambda;_). The original Bernoulli factory for _f_, if it exists, has bias 0 and variance _f_(_&lambda;_)\*(1&minus;_f_(_&lambda;_)), but the approximate Bernoulli factory has bias _g_(_&lambda;_) &minus; _f_(_&lambda;_) and variance _g_(_&lambda;_)\*(1&minus;_g_(_&lambda;_)). ("Variance reduction" methods are outside the scope of this document.)  An estimation algorithm's _mean squared error_ equals variance plus square of bias.
> 4. There are two known approximations to the linear function $f(\lambda) = 2\lambda$ using a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree $n$ that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself.  In each case, if _g_(_&lambda;_) is that polynomial and if $0\le\lambda\le 1/2$, then the error in approximating _f_(_&lambda;_) is no greater than 1&minus;_g_(1/2).
>     - In Henderson and Glynn (2003, Remark 4\)[^12], the polynomial's _j_<sup>th</sup> Bernstein coefficient (starting at 0) is min((_j_/_n_)\*2, 1&minus;1/_n_).  The polynomial _g_ can be computed with the SymPy computer algebra library as follows: `from sympy.stats import *; g=2*E( Min(sum(Bernoulli(("B%d" % (i)),z) for i in range(n))/n,(S(1)-S(1)/n)/2))`.
>     - In Nacu and Peres (2005, section 6\)[^1], the polynomial's _j_<sup>th</sup> Bernstein coefficient (starting at 0) is min((_j_/_i_)\*2, 1). It corresponds to the following algorithm: Flip the input coin _n_ times or until the ratio of "heads" to "flips" becomes at least 1/2, whichever comes first, then if _n_ flips were made without the ratio becoming at least 1/2, return 0; otherwise, return 1.

<a id=Achievable_Simulation_Rates></a>

## Achievable Simulation Rates

In general, the number of input coin flips needed by any Bernoulli factory algorithm for a factory function _f_(_&lambda;_) depends on how "smooth" the function _f_ is.

The following table summarizes the rate of simulation (in terms of the number of input coin flips needed) that can be achieved _in theory_ depending on _f_(_&lambda;_), assuming the input coin's probability of heads is unknown.  In the following table:

- _&lambda;_, the unknown probability of heads, is _&epsilon;_ or greater and (1&minus;_&epsilon;_) or less for some _&epsilon;_ &gt; 0.
- The simulation makes use of a _fair coin_ (a coin that shows 1 or 0 with equal probability) in addition to input coin flips.
- _&Delta;_(_n_, _r_, _&lambda;_) = max(sqrt(_&lambda;_\*(1&minus;_&lambda;_)/_n_),1/_n_)<sup>_r_</sup>.

|   Property of simulation   |   Property of _f_
  ------------- |  ------------------------
| Requires no more than _n_ input coin flips. | If and only if _f_ can be written as a polynomial of degree _n_ with Bernstein coefficients in the closed unit interval (Goyal and Sigman 2012\)[^7]. |
| Requires a finite number of flips on average. Also known as "realizable" by Flajolet et al. (2010\)[^13]. | Only if _f_ is Lipschitz continuous (Nacu and Peres 2005\)[^1].<br/>Whenever _f_ admits a fast simulation (Mendo 2019\)[^14].  |
| Number of flips required, raised to power of _r_, is bounded by a finite number on average and has a tail that drops off uniformly over _f_'s domain.  | Only if _f_ has continuous _r_-th derivative (Nacu and Peres 2005\)[^1]. |
| Requires more than _n_ flips with at most a probability proportional to _&Delta;_(_n_, _r_ + 1, _&lambda;_), for integer _r_ &ge; 0 and every _&lambda;_, and for large enough _n_. (The greater _r_ is, the faster the simulation.) | Only if _f_ has an _r_-th derivative that is continuous and in the Zygmund class (see note below) (Holtz et al. 2011, Theorem 13\)[^15]. |
| Requires more than _n_ flips with at most a probability proportional to _&Delta;_(_n_, _&alpha;_, _&lambda;_), for noninteger _&alpha;_ &gt; 0 and every _&lambda;_, and for large enough _n_. (The greater _&alpha;_ is, the faster the simulation.) | If and only if _f_ has an _r_-th derivative that is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent (_&alpha;_ &minus; _r_) or greater, where _r_ = floor(_&alpha;_) (Holtz et al. 2011, Theorem 8\)[^15]. Assumes _f_ is bounded away from 0 and 1. |
| "Fast simulation" (requires more than _n_ flips with a probability that decays exponentially or faster as _n_ gets large).  Also known as "strongly realizable" by Flajolet et al. (2010\)[^13]. | If and only if _f_ is analytic at every point in its domain (see note below) (Nacu and Peres 2005\)[^1].   |
| Average number of flips greater than or equal to (_f&prime;_(_&lambda;_))<sup>2</sup>\*_&lambda;_\*(1&minus;_&lambda;_)/(_f_(_&lambda;_)\*(1&minus;_f_(_&lambda;_))), where _f&prime;_ is the first derivative of _f_.  | Whenever _f_ admits a fast simulation (Mendo 2019\)[^14]. |

[^3]: Thomas and Blanchet (2012) dealt with building polynomials that approach piecewise linear functions "fast".  Their strategy for $f(\lambda)=\min(mult\times\lambda, 1-2\varepsilon)$ is to first compute a low-degree polynomial $P$ satisfying $P(0)=0$ and otherwise greater than $f$, and then compute further polynomials of increasing degree that each come between $f$ and the previous polynomial and satisfy the consistency requirement. These polynomials approach $f$ rapidly when $\lambda$ is near 0, and extremely slowly when $\lambda$ is near 1. In their strategy, **fbelow(_n_, _k_)** is min((_k_/_n_)\*_mult_, 1&minus;_&epsilon;_), and **fabove(_n_, _k_)** is min((_k_/_n_)\*_y_/_x_,_y_), where:<br>_x_ = &minus;((_y_&minus;(1&minus;_&epsilon;_))/_&epsilon;_)<sup>5</sup>/_mult_ + _y_/_mult_. (This formula doesn't appear in their paper, but in the [**supplemental source code**](https://github.com/acthomasca/rberfac/blob/main/rberfac-public-2.R) uploaded by A. C. Thomas at my request.)<br>_y_ satisfies 0&lt;_y_&lt;1 and is chosen so that the degree-_n_ polynomial is between $f$ and the previous polynomial and meets the consistency requirement. The supplemental source code seems to choose _y_ in an _ad hoc_ manner.<br>_n_ is the polynomial's degree.

[^4]: In Nacu and Peres (2005), the following polynomial sequences were suggested to simulate $\min(2\lambda, 1-2\varepsilon)$ (using the algorithms from the section "General Factory Functions" in "[**Bernoulli Factory Algorithms**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html)"), provided $\varepsilon \lt 1/8$, where _n_ is a power of 2.  However, with these sequences, each simulation will require an extraordinary number of input coin flips. **fbelow(_n_, _k_)** = $\min(2(k/n), 1-2\varepsilon)$. **fabove(_n_, _k_)** = $\min(2(k/n), 1-2\varepsilon)$ + $\frac{2\times\max(0, k/n+3\varepsilon - 1/2)}{\varepsilon(2-\sqrt{2})}$ $\sqrt{2/n}$ + $\frac{72\times\max(0,k/n-1/9)}{1-\exp(-2\times\varepsilon^2)} \exp(-2n\times\varepsilon^2)$.

[^5]: In this case, an algorithm to simulate `High`(_&lambda;_) is: Flip the input coin _n_ times or until a flip returns 1, whichever comes first, then output the last coin flip result.

[^6]: With this infinite sum and these upper bounds, Lemma 4 of Holtz et al. (2011\) says that a Bernoulli factory algorithm for $f(\lambda)$ is possible.

### Examples of Well-Behaved Functions

In the examples given in this section, _f_(_&lambda;_) is a function defined on the closed unit interval.

Generally, how well-behaved a function is depends on how many continuous derivatives it has, and whether those derivatives are Lipschitz continuous or Hölder continuous, among other things.  The following lists several classes of functions, from worst to best behaved and from "largest" to "smallest":

Functions continuous except possibly at one point &rarr; Continuous functions &rarr; Hölder continuous functions &rarr; Lipschitz continuous functions &rarr; With continuous first derivative &rarr; With Hölder continuous first derivative &rarr;  With Lipschitz continuous first derivative &rarr; With continuous second derivative &rarr; With infinitely many derivatives &rarr; Analytic functions.

**Concave and convex functions.**  The following table shows examples of functions that are convex, concave, or neither.  All these functions are continuous.  Also, review the [**definitions**](#Definitions).

| Function _f_(_&lambda;_)| Convex or concave? | Notes |
 --- | --- | --- |
| 1&minus; _&lambda;_<sup>2</sup>. | Concave. | |
| _&lambda;_<sup>2</sup>. | Convex. | |
| _&lambda;_<sup>2</sup> &minus; _&lambda;_<sup>3</sup>. | Neither. | |
| _&lambda;_<sup>_z_</sup>, where 0&lt; _z_&le; 1. | Concave. | |
| _&lambda;_<sup>_z_</sup>, where _z_&ge; 1. | Convex. ||
| exp(&minus;_&lambda;_/4). | Concave. | |

**Hölder and Lipschitz continuous functions.** The following table shows some functions that are Hölder continuous and some that are not.  Also, review the [**definitions**](#Definitions).

| Function _f_(_&lambda;_)\: | Hölder exponent (_&alpha;_) and an upper bound of the Hölder constant (_H_)\: | Notes |
 --- | --- | --- |
|$\lambda^z\cdot t$. | _&alpha;_=_z_.<br>_L_=abs(_t_). | $0\lt z\le 1$, $t\ne 0$. |
|$\lambda^z\cdot t$. | _&alpha;_=1 (Lipschitz continuous).<br>_L_=_z_\*abs(_t_). | $z\ge 1$, $t$ is a real number. |
|$\lambda^{1/3}/4 + \lambda^{2/3}$/5. | _&alpha;_=1/3.<br>_L_=9/20. |  _&alpha;_ is the minimum of Hölder exponents, min(1/3, 2/3), and _L_ is the sum of Hölder constants, 1/4+1/5. |
|$1/2-(1-2\lambda)^{z}/2$ if $\lambda<1/2$ and $1/2+(2\lambda-1)^{z}/2$ otherwise. | _&alpha;_=_z_.<br>_L_=$2^z/2$. | $0\lt z\le 1$.  In this example, $f$ has a "vertical" slope at 1/2, unless _z_ is 1. |
|$3/4-\sqrt{\lambda(1-\lambda)}$. | _&alpha;_=1/2.<br>_L_=1. | Has a "vertical" slope at 0 and 1. |
| Continuous and **piecewise linear**. | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ is the greatest absolute value of the slope among all pieces' slopes. | _f_(_&lambda;_) is _piecewise linear_ if it's made up of multiple linear functions defined on a finite number of "pieces", or nonempty subintervals, that together make up $f$'s domain (in this case, the closed unit interval). |
| Piecewise linear; equals 0 at 0, 3/4 at 2/3 and 1/4 at 1, and these points are connected by linear functions. | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ = 1.5. | _L_ = $\max(\text{abs}((3/4-0)/(2/3))$, $\text{abs}((1/4-3/4)/(1/3)))$.<br>Concave because the first piece's slope is greater than the second piece's. |
| min(_&lambda;_\*_mult_, 1&minus;_&epsilon;_). | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ = _mult_. | _mult_ &gt; 0, _&epsilon;_ &gt; 0.  Piecewise linear; equals 0 at 0, 1&minus;_&epsilon;_ at (1&minus;_&epsilon;_)/_mult_, and 1&minus;_&epsilon;_ at 1.<br>_L_=max(_mult_, 0).<br>Concave. |
| 1/10 if _&lambda;_ is 0; &minus;1/(2\*ln(_&lambda;_/2)) + 1/10 otherwise. | Not Hölder continuous. | Has a slope near 0 that's steeper than every "nth" root. |

> **Note:** A Hölder continuous function with Hölder exponent _&alpha;_ and Hölder constant _L_ is also Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent _&beta;_ and Hölder constant bounded above by _L_, where 0 &lt; _&beta;_ &lt; _&alpha;_.

**Finding parameters _&alpha;_ and _L_ for Hölder continuous functions.** If $f(\lambda)$ is continuous, the following is one way to find the Hölder exponent (_&alpha;_) and Hölder constant (_L_) of $f$, to determine whether $f$ is Hölder continuous, not just continuous.

First, if $f$ has a bounded and continuous first derivative on its domain, then _&alpha;_ is 1 ($f$ is **Lipschitz continuous**) and _L_ is the maximum of the absolute value of that derivative.

Otherwise, consider the function $h(\lambda, c)=\text{abs}(f(\lambda)-f(c))/((\text{abs}(\lambda-c))^\alpha)$, or 0 if $\lambda=c$, where $0\lt\alpha\le 1$ is a Hölder exponent to test. For a given $\alpha$, let $g(\lambda)$ be the maximum of $h(\lambda,c)$ over all points $c$ where $f$ has a "vertical slope" or the "steepest slope exhibited".  If $g(\lambda)$ is bounded for a given $\alpha$ on $f$'s domain (in this case, the closed unit interval), then $f$ is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent $\alpha$ and Hölder constant (_L_) equal to or greater than the maximum value of $g(\lambda)$ on its domain.

The following example, which uses the SymPy computer algebra library, plots $\max(h(\lambda,0),h(\lambda,1))$ when $f=\sqrt{\lambda(1-\lambda)}$ and $\alpha=1/2$: `lamda,c=symbols('lamda c'); func=sqrt(lamda*(1-lamda)); alpha=S(1)/2; h=Abs(func-func.subs(lamda,c))/Abs(lamda-c)**alpha; plot(Max(h.subs(c, 0), h.subs(c,1)), (lamda, 0, 1))`.

**Functions with a Hölder continuous or Lipschitz continuous derivative.** The following table shows some functions whose derivatives are Hölder continuous, and others where that is not the case. (In the SymPy library, a function's derivative can be found using the `diff` method.) In the following table, if $f$ has a bounded and continuous _second_ derivative on its domain, then _&alpha;_ is 1 (the first derivative is Lipschitz continuous) and _L_ is the maximum of the absolute value of that _second_ derivative.

| Function $f(\lambda)$ | Derivative's Hölder exponent (_&alpha;_) and an upper bound of the derivative's Hölder constant (_L_): | Notes |
 ---- | ---- | ---- |
| _&lambda;_<sup>1+_&beta;_</sup> | _&alpha;_=_&beta;_.<br>_L_ = 1+_&beta;_. | 0 &lt; _&beta;_ &le; 1. |
|$3/4-\sqrt{\lambda(1-\lambda)}$. | Derivative is not Hölder continuous. | Derivative is not Hölder continuous because $f$ is not Lipschitz continuous. |
| cosh(_&lambda;_) &minus; 3/4. | _&alpha;_=1 (derivative is Lipschitz continuous).<br>_L_ = cosh(1). | Continuous second derivative, namely cosh(_&lambda;_).  Convex. `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function. |
| $\lambda\cdot\sin(z\lambda)/4+1/2$. | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ = $z(2+z\lambda)/4$. | Continuous second derivative. _L_ is an upper bound of its absolute value. $z>0$. |
| $\sin(z\lambda)/4+1/2$. | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ = $(z^2)/4$. | Continuous second derivative; _L_ is an upper bound of its absolute value, namely abs($-\sin(z\lambda)\cdot z^2/4$). $z>0$. |
| _&lambda;_<sup>2</sup>/2 + 1/10 if _&lambda;_ &le; 1/2; _&lambda;_/2 &minus; 1/40 otherwise. | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ = 1. | Lipschitz continuous derivative, with Lipschitz constant 1. |
| exp(&minus;_&lambda;_). | _&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_ = 1. | Lipschitz continuous derivative, with Lipschitz constant 1.[^16] |
| _&lambda;_/2 if _&lambda;_ &le; 1/2; (4\*_&lambda;_ &minus; 1)/(8\*_&lambda;_) otherwise. |_&alpha;_=1.<br>_L_=1.| Concave. Lipschitz continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant 2. |

### How Many Coin Flips Are Needed to Simulate a Polynomial?

Let $p(\lambda)$ be a polynomial that maps the closed unit interval to itself and satisfies $0\lt p(\lambda)\lt 1$ whenever $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$.

Then $p$'s _coin-flipping degree_ (Wästlund 1999)[^17] is the smallest value of $n$ such that $p$'s Bernstein coefficients of degree $n$ lie in the closed unit interval. [^18]  \(This is broader than the use of the term in Wästlund, where a polynomial can have a coin-flipping degree only if its "power" coefficients are integers.)  The coin-flipping degree is the smallest value of $n$ such that the algorithm of Goyal and Sigman (2012)[^7] can toss heads with probability $p(\lambda)$ using exactly $n$ biased coin flips (in addition to a fair coin).

The following results give upper bounds on $p$'s coin-flipping degree.

Suppose $p$ is in Bernstein form of degree $m$ with Bernstein coefficients $b_0, ..., b_m$.  Then:

- If $0\le\min(b_0, ..., b_m)\le\max(b_0, ..., b_m)\le 1$, then the coin-flipping degree is bounded above by $m$.
- If $0\le\min(b_0, ..., b_m)$ and $\max(b_0, ..., b_m)\gt 1$, then the coin-flipping degree is bounded above by&mdash;

    $$m+\text{iceil}\left(\frac{m(m-1)}{2}\frac{\max(1-b_0, ..., 1-b_m)}{1-\text{Pmax}} - m\right),$$

    where iceil($x$) is $x+1$ if $x$ is an integer, or ceil($x$) otherwise, and where $\text{Pmax}$ is the maximum value of $p(\lambda)$ on the closed unit interval (Powers and Reznick 2001)[^19].
- If $\min(b_0, ..., b_m)\lt 0$ and $\max(b_0, ..., b_m)\le 1$, then the coin-flipping degree is bounded above by&mdash;

    $$m+\text{iceil}\left(\frac{m(m-1)}{2}\frac{\max(b_0, ..., b_m)}{\text{Pmin}} - m\right),$$

    where $\text{Pmin}$ is the _minimum_ value of $p(\lambda)$ on the closed unit interval (Powers and Reznick 2001)[^19].
- Suppose $m\ge 2$, that $b_0=0$ or $b_m=0$ or both, and that the following necessary conditions are satisfied (Mok and To 2008; Theorem 1 and Corollary 3)[^20]\:

    - For every $i$ such that $b_i\lt 0$, if $b_m=0$, there must be $j\gt i$ such that $b_j\gt 0$.
    - For every $i$ such that $b_i\lt 0$, if $b_0=0$, there must be $j\lt i$ such that $b_j\gt 0$.
    - For every $i$ such that $b_i\gt 1$, if $b_m=1$, there must be $j\gt i$ such that $b_j\lt 1$.
    - For every $i$ such that $b_i\gt 1$, if $b_0=1$, there must be $j\lt i$ such that $b_j\lt 1$.

    Then the coin-flipping degree is bounded above by&mdash;

    $$ \max(M(b_0, ..., b_m), M(1-b_0, ..., 1-b_m)),$$

    where&mdash;

    $$M(\beta_0, ..., \beta_m) = \text{ceil}\left(\max\left(2m, \frac{m(m-1)}{2(1-c)}\frac{a_{\max}}{a_{\min}}\right)\right),$$

    and where:

    - $a_{\max} = \max(\max(0,\beta_0),  ..., \max(0, \beta_m))$.
    - $a_{\min}$ is the minimum of $(\beta_i{m\choose i})$ over all values of $i$ such that $\beta_i>0$.
    - $c$ is the smallest number $r$ that satisfies $FN(\lambda)/FP(\lambda)\le r$ where $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$.  $c$ can also be a greater number but less than 1.
    - $FP(\lambda) = \sum_{k=0}^m \max(0,\beta_k){m\choose k}\lambda^k(1-\lambda)^{m-k}$.
    - $FN(\lambda) = \sum_{k=0}^m \text{abs}(\min(0,\beta_k)){m\choose k}\lambda^k(1-\lambda)^{m-k}$.

    (Mok and To 2008; Theorem 2 and remark 1.5(v))[^20].

> **Examples:**
>
> 1. Let $p(\lambda)=1 -8\lambda +20\lambda^2 -13\lambda^3$, a polynomial of degree $m=3$.  $p$'s Bernstein coefficients are $b_0=1, b_1=-5/3, b_2=7/3, b_3=0$, and its coin-flipping degree is 46 (Wästlund 1999, Example 4.4)[^17].  $p$ meets the conditions to use the coin-flipping degree derived from Mok and To (2008)[^20].  In this case, after some calculations, the coin-flipping degree is bounded above by&mdash;
>
>     $$\text{ceil}\left(\max\left(\max\left(2\cdot 3, \frac{3(3-1)}{2(1-0.94492)}\frac{7/3}{1}\right), \max\left(2\cdot 3, \frac{3(3-1)}{2(1-0.70711)}\frac{8/3}{1}\right)\right)\right)\le 128.$$
> 2. An exhaustive search shows that 46 is the highest possible coin-flipping degree for a degree-3 polynomial whose "power" coefficients are integers.
> 3. The degree-4 polynomial $-43\lambda^4 + 81\lambda^3 - 47\lambda^2 + 9\lambda$ has a coin-flipping degree of 5284.
>
> **Note:** If a polynomial's "power" coefficients can be rational numbers (ratios of two integers), even a degree-2 polynomial can have an arbitrarily high coin-flipping degree.  An example is the family of degree-2 polynomials $r\lambda-r\lambda^2$, where $r$ is a rational number greater than 0 and less than 4.

**Lemma:** Let $p(\lambda)=a_0 \lambda^0 + ... + a_n \lambda^n$ be a polynomial that maps the closed unit interval to itself.  Then the values $a_0, ..., a_n$ must sum to a value that is 0 or greater and 1 or less.

_Proof_:  This can be seen by evaluating $p(1) = a_0 + ... + a_n$.  If $p(1)$ is less than 0 or greater than 1, then $p$ does not meet the hypothesis of the lemma. &#x25a1;

In the following lemmas, let $p(\lambda)=a_0 \lambda^0 + ... + a_n \lambda^n$ be a polynomial that maps the closed unit interval to itself and satisfies $0\lt p(\lambda)\lt 1$ whenever $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$.

**Lemma:** If $p$'s coin-flipping degree is $n$, then $\text{abs}(a_i)\le 2^i {n\choose i}$.

_Proof_: Consider the matrix that transforms a polynomial's Bernstein coefficients to "power" coefficients, which is $n\times n$ if the polynomial's degree is $n$ (Ray and Nataraj 2012, eq. (8))[^21].  Given the hypothesis of the lemma, each Bernstein coefficient must lie in the closed unit interval and the required matrix size is $n$, which is $p$'s coin-flipping degree.  For each row of the matrix ($0\le i\le n$), the corresponding "power" coefficient of the polynomial equals a linear combination of that row with a vector of Bernstein coefficients.  Thus, the $i$-th power coefficient equals $a_i$ and its absolute value is bounded above by $\sum_{m=0}^i {n\choose m}{n-m\choose i-m} = 2^i {n\choose i}$.  &#x25a1;

**Lemma:**  $\text{abs}(a_i)\le \text{abs}(b_i)$, where $b_i$ is the corresponding power coefficient of the following polynomial:

$$q(\lambda) = b_0 \lambda^0 + ... + b_n\lambda^n = (T_n(1-2\lambda)+1)/2,$$

and where $T_n(x)$ is the [**Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind**](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebyshevPolynomialoftheFirstKind.html) of degree $n$.

### Proofs for Polynomial-Building Schemes

This section shows mathematical proofs for some of the polynomial-building schemes of this page.

In the following results:

- A _strictly bounded factory function_ means a continuous function on the closed unit interval, with a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1.
- A function _f_(_&lambda;_) is _polynomially bounded_ if both _f_(_&lambda;_) and 1&minus;_f_(_&lambda;_) are greater than or equal to min(_&lambda;_<sup>_n_</sup>, (1&minus;_&lambda;_)<sup>_n_</sup>) for some integer _n_ (Keane and O'Brien 1994\)[^22].  For examples, see "[**About Bernoulli Factories**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#About_Bernoulli_Factories)".
- A _modulus of continuity_ of a function _f_ means a nonnegative and nowhere decreasing function _&omega;_ on the closed unit interval, for which _&omega;_(0) = 0, and for which abs(f(_x_) &minus; f(_y_)) &le; _&omega;_(abs(_x_&minus;_y_)) whenever _x_ and _y_ are in _f_'s domain.  Loosely speaking, a modulus of continuity _&omega;_(_&delta;_) is greater than or equal to _f_'s maximum range in a window of size _&delta;_.

**Lemma 1.** Omitted.

Lemma 6(i) of Nacu and Peres (2005\)[^1] can be applied to continuous functions beyond just Lipschitz continuous functions.  This includes the larger class of _Hölder continuous_ functions (see "[**Definitions**](#Definitions)").

**Lemma 2.** _Let f(&lambda;) be a continuous function that maps the closed unit interval to itself, let X be a hypergeometric(2\*n, k, n) random variable, and let $n\ge 1$ be an integer._

1. _Let &omega;(x) be a modulus of continuity of f.  If &omega; is continuous and concave, then the expression&mdash;<br>abs(**E**[f(X/n)] &minus; f(k/(2\*n))),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<br>is less than or equal to each of the following:_
    - _&omega;(sqrt(1/(8\*n&minus;4)))._
    - _&omega;(sqrt(1/(7\*n))) if n&ge;4._
    - _&omega;(sqrt(1/(2\*n)))._
    - _&omega;(sqrt( (k/(2\*n)) \* (1&minus;k/(2\*n)) / (2\*n&minus;1) ))._
2. _If f is Hölder continuous with Hölder constant M and with Hölder exponent &alpha; such that 0 < &alpha; &le; 1, then the expression (1) is less than or equal to&mdash;_
    - _M\*(1/(2\*n))$\alpha/2$,_
    - _M\*(1/(7\*n))$\alpha/2$ if n&ge;4, and_
    - _M\*(1/(8\*n&minus;4))$\alpha/2$._
3. _If f has a Lipschitz continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant M, then the expression (1) is less than or equal to&mdash;_
    - _(M/2)\*(1/(7\*n)) if n&ge;4, and_
    - _(M/2)\*(1/(8\*n&minus;4))._

_Proof._

1. _&omega;_ is assumed to be nonnegative because absolute values are nonnegative.  To prove the first and second bounds: abs(**E**[_f_(_X_/_n_)] &minus; _f_(_k_/(2 \* _n_))) &le; **E**[abs(_f_(_X_/_n_) &minus; _f_(_k_/(2 \* _n_))] &le; **E**\[_&omega;_(abs(_X_/_n_ &minus; _k_/(2 \* _n_))] (by the definition of _&omega;_) &le; _&omega;_(**E**[abs(_X_/_n_ &minus; _k_/(2 \* _n_))]) (by Jensen's inequality and because _&omega;_ is concave) &le; _&omega;_(sqrt(**E**[abs(_X_/_n_ &minus; _k_/(2 \* _n_))]<sup>2</sup>)) = _&omega;_(sqrt(**Var**[_X_/_n_])) = _&omega;_(sqrt((_k_\*(2 \* _n_&minus;_k_)/(4\*(2 \* _n_&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>2</sup>)))) &le; _&omega;_(sqrt((_n_<sup>2</sup>/(4\*(2 \* _n_&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>2</sup>)))) = _&omega;_(sqrt((1/(8\*_n_&minus;4)))) = _&rho;_, and for every integer _n_&ge;4, _&rho;_ &le; _&omega;_(sqrt(1/(7\*_n_))).  To prove the third bound: abs(**E**[_f_(_X_/_n_)] &minus; _f_(_k_/(2 \* _n_))) &le; _&omega;_(sqrt(**Var**[_X_/_n_])) &le; _&omega;_(sqrt(1/(2\*n))).  To prove the fourth bound: abs(**E**[_f_(_X_/_n_)] &minus; _f_(_k_/(2 \* _n_))) &le; _&omega;_(sqrt((_n_<sup>2</sup>/(4\*(2 \* _n_&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>2</sup>)))) = _&omega;_(sqrt( (_k_/(2\*_n_)) \* (1&minus;_k_/(2\*_n_)) / (2\*_n_&minus;1) )).
2. By the definition of Hölder continuous functions, take _&omega;_(_x_) = _M_\*_x_<sup>_&alpha;_</sup>.  Because _&omega;_ is a concave modulus of continuity on the closed unit interval, the result follows from part 1.
3. (Much of this proof builds on Nacu and Peres 2005, Proposition 6(ii)[^1].) The expected value (see note 1) of $X$ is $E[X/n]=k/(2n)$. Since $E[X/n-k/(2n)] = 0$, it follows that $f'(X/n) E(X/n-k/(2n)) = 0$.  Moreover, $\text{abs}(f(x)-f(s)-f'(x)(x-s))\le (M/2)(x-s)^2$ (see Micchelli 1973, Theorem 3.2)[^23], so&mdash;

     $$E[\text{abs}(f(X/n)-f(k/(2n)))]=\text{abs}(E[f(X/n)-f(k/(2n))-f'(k/(2n))(X/n-k/(2n))])$$

     $$\le (M/2)(X/n-k/(2n))^2 \le (M/2) Var(X/n).$$

     By part 1's proof, it follows that (_M_/2)\***Var**[_X_/_n_] = (_M_/2)\*(_k_\*(2 \* _n_&minus;_k_)/(4\*(2 \* _n_&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>2</sup>)) &le; (_M_/2)\*(_n_<sup>2</sup>/(4\*(2 \* _n_&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>2</sup>)) = (_M_/2)\*(1/(8\*_n_&minus;4)) = _&rho;_.  For every integer _n_&ge;4, _&rho;_ &le;  (_M_/2)\*(1/(7\*_n_)). &#x25a1;

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. **E**[.] means expected value ("long-run average"), and **Var**[.] means variance.  A hypergeometric(2 \* _n_, _k_, _n_) random variable is the number of "good" balls out of _n_ balls taken uniformly at random, all at once, from a bag containing 2 \* _n_ balls, _k_ of which are "good".
> 2. Parts 1 through 3 exploit a tighter bound on **Var**[_X_/_n_] than the bound given in Nacu and Peres (2005, Lemma 6(i) and 6(ii), respectively\)[^1].  However, for technical reasons, different bounds are proved for different ranges of integers _n_.
> 3. All continuous functions that map the closed unit interval to itself, including all of them that admit a Bernoulli factory, have a modulus of continuity.  The proof of part 1 remains valid even if _&omega;_(0) > 0, because the bounds proved remain correct even if _&omega;_ is overestimated.  The following functions have a simple modulus of continuity that satisfies the lemma:
>     1. If _f_ is strictly increasing and convex, _&omega;_(_x_) can equal _f_(1) &minus; _f_(1&minus;_x_) (Gal 1990\)[^24]; (Gal 1995\)[^25].
>     2. If _f_ is strictly decreasing and convex, _&omega;_(_x_) can equal _f_(0) &minus; _f_(_x_) (Gal 1990\)[^24]; (Gal 1995\)[^25].
>     3. If _f_ is strictly increasing and concave, _&omega;_(_x_) can equal _f_(_x_) &minus; _f_(0) (by symmetry with 2).
>     4. If _f_ is strictly decreasing and concave, _&omega;_(_x_) can equal _f_(1&minus;_x_) &minus; _f_(1) (by symmetry with 1).
>     5. If _f_ is concave and is strictly increasing then strictly decreasing, then _&omega;_(_h_) can equal (_f_(min(_h_, _&sigma;_))+(_f_(1&minus;min(_h_, 1&minus;_&sigma;_))&minus;_f_(1)), where _&sigma;_ is the point where _f_ stops increasing and starts decreasing (Anastassiou and Gal 2012\)[^26].

There are weaker bounds for Lemma 2, part 1, which work even if $f$'s modulus of continuity $\omega$ is not concave. According to Pascu et al. (2017, Lemma 5.1)[^27]\:

$$\text{abs}(\mathbb{E}[f(Y)] - f(\mathbb{E}[Y])) \le \omega(\delta) + \omega(\delta)\text{Var}[Y]/\delta^2,$$

where $f$ is a continuous function, $Y$ is a discrete random variable on a closed interval, and $\delta>0$.  Given that $Y = X/n$ (where $X$ is as in Lemma 2), taking $\delta=1/n^{1/2}$ leads to:

$$\text{abs}(\mathbb{E}[f(Y)]-f(\mathbb{E}[Y]))=\text{abs}(\mathbb{E}[f(Y)]-f(k/(2n)))\le\omega(1/n^{1/2}) (1+n\cdot\text{Var}[Y]),$$

and in turn, plugging in bounds for $\text{Var}[Y]$ leads to the following bounds for Lemma 2, part 1:

- $\omega(1/n^{1/2}) (1+n/(8n-4))$.
- $\omega(1/n^{1/2}) (1+n/(7n)) = \frac{8}{7}\omega(1/n^{1/2})$ if n&ge;4.
- $\omega(1/n^{1/2}) (1+n/(2n)) = \frac{3}{2}\omega(1/n^{1/2})$.

**Lemma 2A.**  _Let f(&lambda;) map the closed unit interval to itself, and let $C=15$.  Suppose $f$ is in the Zygmund class with constant $D$ or less.  Then, for every integer $n$ &ge; 1, the expression (1) in Lemma 2 is less than or equal to $(C/2) D\sqrt{1/(8n-4)}$.

_Proof._ Strukov and Timan (1977)[^28] proved the following bound:

$$\text{abs}(\mathbb{E}[f(Y)]-f(\mathbb{E}[Y]))\le C\omega_2((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2),$$

where _Y_ is a random variable and &omega;<sub>2</sub>(.) is a _second-order modulus of continuity_ of _f_ (see note below), and where $C$ is 3 if $Y$ takes on any value in the real line, or 15 if $Y$ takes on only values in a closed interval, such as the closed unit interval in this case.

Suppose _Y_ = _X_/_n_, where _X_ is as in Lemma 2.  Then _Y_'s variance (**Var**[_Y_]) is less than or equal to 1/(8\*_n_&minus; 4), and the left-hand side of Strukov and Timan's bound is the same as the expression (1).

Since _f_ is in the Zygmund class, there is an $\omega_2$ for it such that $\omega_{2}(h)\le D h$.  Therefore, applying Strukov and Timan's bound and the bound on _Y_'s variance leads to&mdash;

$$\text{abs}(\mathbb{E}[f(Y)]-f(\mathbb{E}[Y]))\le C\omega_2((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)$$

$$\le CD ((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2) = CD\sqrt{1/(8n-4)}/2.$$

&#x25a1;

> **Note:** A _second-order modulus of continuity_ is a nonnegative and nowhere decreasing function _&omega;_<sub>2</sub>(_h_) with _h_ &ge; 0, for which _&omega;<sub>2</sub>_(0) = 0, and for which abs($f(x)+f(y)-2 f((x+y)/2)$) &le; $\omega_2(\text{abs}((y-x)/2))$ whenever _f_ is continuous and _x_ and _y_ are in _f_'s domain.

**Theorem 1.** _Let $f$ be a strictly bounded factory function, let $n_0\ge 1$ be an integer, and let $\phi(n)$ be a function that takes on a nonnegative value.  Suppose $f$ is such that the expression (1) in Lemma 2 is less than or equal to $\phi(n)$ whenever $n\ge n_0$ is an integer power of 2.  Let&mdash;_

$$\eta(n)=\sum_{k\ge \log_2(n)} \phi(2^k),$$

_for every integer n&ge;1 that's a power of 2.  If the series &eta;(n) converges to a finite value for each such $n$, and if it converges to 0 as $n$ gets large, then the following scheme for f(&lambda;) is valid in the following sense:_

_There are polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ (where $n\ge 1$ is an integer power of 2) as follows. The $k$-th Bernstein coefficient of $g_n$ and $h_n$ is **fbelow**(n, k) and **fabove**(n, k), respectively (where $0\le k\le n$), where:_

_If $n_0 = 1$:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) =_ $f(k/n)-\eta(n)$.
- _**fabove**(n, k) =_ $f(k/n)+\eta(n)$.

_If $n_0 > 1$:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) =_ min(**fbelow**($n_0$,0), **fbelow**($n_0$,1), ..., **fbelow**($n_0$,$n_0$)) _if_ $n < n_0$; $f(k/n)-\eta(n)$ _otherwise._
- _**fabove**(n, k) =_ max(**fabove**($n_0$,0), **fabove**($n_0$,1), ..., **fbelow**($n_0$,$n_0$)) _if_ $n < n_0$; $f(k/n)+\eta(n)$ _otherwise._

_The polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ satisfy:_

1. _$g_n \le h_n$._
2. _$g_n$ and $h_n$ converge to $f$ as $n$ gets large._
3. $(g_{n+1}-g_n)$ _and_ $(h_{n}-h_{n+1})$ _are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once they are rewritten to polynomials in Bernstein form of degree exactly $n+1$._

_Proof._ For simplicity, this proof assumes first that $n_0 = 1$.

For the series _&eta;_(_n_) in the theorem, because $\phi(n)$ is nonnegative, each term of the series is nonnegative making the series nonnegative and, by the assumption that the series converges, _&eta;_(_n_) is nowhere increasing with increasing _n_.

Item 1 is trivial.  If $n\ge n_0$, $g_n$ is simply the Bernstein polynomial of $f$ minus a nonnegative value, and $h_n$ is the Bernstein polynomial of $f$ plus that same value, and if $n$ is less than $n_0$, $g_n$ is a constant value not less than the lowest point reachable by the lower polynomials, and $h_n$ is a constant value not less than the highest point reachable by the upper polynomials.

Item 2 is likewise trivial. A well known result is that the Bernstein polynomials of $f$ converge to $f$ as their degree $n$ gets large.  And because the series _&eta;_ (in Theorem 1) sums to a finite value that goes to 0 as $n$ increases, the upper and lower shifts will converge to 0 so that $g_n$ and $h_n$ converge to the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomials and thus to $f$.

Item 3 is the _consistency requirement_ described earlier in this page. This is ensured as in Proposition 10 of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] by bounding, from below, the offset by which to shift the approximating polynomials.  This lower bound is _&eta;_(_n_), a solution to the equation 0 = _&eta;_(_n_) &minus; _&eta;_(2 \* _n_) &minus; _&phi;_(_n_) (see note below), where _&phi;_(_n_) is a function that takes on a nonnegative value.

_&phi;_(_n_) is, roughly speaking, the minimum distance between one polynomial and the next so that the consistency requirement is met between those two polynomials.  Compare the assumptions on _&phi;_ in Theorem 1 with equations (10) and (11) in Nacu and Peres (2005).

The solution for $\eta(n)$ given in the statement of the theorem is easy to prove by noting that this is a recursive process: we start by calculating the series for _n_ = 2\*_n_, then adding _&phi;_(_n_) to it (which will be positive), in effect working backwards and recursively, and we can easily see that we can calculate the series for _n_ = 2\*_n_ only if the series converges, hence the assumption of a converging series.

Now to prove the result assuming that $n_0 > 1$.

Doing this involves taking advantage of the observation in Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] that we can start defining the polynomials at any $n$ greater than 0, including $n = n_0$; in that case, the upper and lower polynomials of degree 1 or greater, but less than $n_0$, would be constant functions, so that the Bernstein coefficients of each polynomial would be equal. The lower constants are no greater than $g_{n_0}$'s lowest Bernstein coefficient, and the upper constants are no less than $g_{n_0}$'s highest Bernstein coefficients; they meet Item 3 because these lower and upper constants, when rewritten as polynomials in Bernstein form of degree $n_0$, have Bernstein coefficients that are still no greater or no less, respectively, than the corresponding degree-$n_0$ polynomial. With the _&phi;_ given in this theorem, the series _&eta;_(_n_) in the theorem remains nonnegative.  Moreover, since _&eta;_ is assumed to converge, _&eta;_(_n_) still decreases with increasing _n_. &#x25a1;

> 1. There is only one solution _&eta;_(_n_) in the case at hand.  Unlike so-called [**_functional equations_**](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3993739) and linear recurrences, with a solution that varies depending on the starting value, there is only one solution in the case at hand, namely the solution that makes the series converge, if it exists at all.  Alternatively, the equation can be expanded to 0 = _&eta;_(_n_) &minus; _&eta;_(4 \* _n_) &minus; _&phi;_(2\*_n_) &minus; _&phi;_(_n_) = _&eta;_(_n_) &minus; _&eta;_(8 \* _n_) &minus; _&phi;_(4\*_n_) &minus; _&phi;_(2\*_n_) &minus; _&phi;_(_n_) = ...

**Proposition 1A.** _If a scheme satisfies Theorem 1, the polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ in the scheme can be made to satisfy conditions (i), (iii), and (iv) of Proposition 3 of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] as follows:_

- $g_n$ = $g_{n-1}$ _and_ $h_n$ = $h_{n-1}$ _whenever $n$ is an integer greater than 1 and not a power of 2._
- _If **fabove**(n, k) > 1 for a given $n$ and some $k$, the Bernstein coefficients of $h_n$ (the upper polynomial) are all 1._
- _If **fbelow**(n, k) < 0 for a given $n$ and some $k$, the Bernstein coefficients of $g_n$ (the lower polynomial) are all 0._

_Proof:_ Condition (i) of Proposition 3 says that each Bernstein coefficient of the polynomials must be 0 or greater and 1 or less.  This is ensured starting with a large enough value of _n_ greater than 0 that's a power of 2, call it _n_<sub>1</sub>, as shown next.

Let _&epsilon;_ be a positive distance between 0 and the minimum or between 1 and the maximum of _f_, whichever is smaller.  This _&epsilon;_ exists by the assumption that _f_ is bounded away from 0 and 1. Because the series _&eta;_ (in Theorem 1) sums to a finite value that goes to 0 as $n$ increases, _&eta;_(_n_) will eventually stay less than _&epsilon;_.  And if $n\ge n_0$ is a power of 2 (where $n_0$ is as in Theorem 1), the `f(k/n)` term is bounded by the minimum and maximum of _f_ by construction. This combined means that the lower and upper polynomials' Bernstein coefficients will eventually be bounded by 0 and 1 for every integer _n_ starting with _n_<sub>1</sub>.

For _n_ less than _n_<sub>1</sub>, condition (i) is ensured by setting the lower or upper polynomial's Bernstein coefficient to 0 or 1, respectively, whenever a Bernstein coefficient of the degree-_n_ polynomial would otherwise be less than 0 or greater than 1, respectively.

Condition (iii) of Proposition 3 is mostly ensured by item 2 of Theorem 1.  The only thing to add is that for $n$ less than _n_<sub>1</sub>, the lower and upper polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ can be treated as 0 or 1, respectively, without affecting convergence, and that for $n$ other than a power of 2, defining $g_n = g_{n-1}$ and $h_n = h_{n-1}$ maintains condition (iii) by Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1].

Condition (iv) of Proposition 3 is mostly ensured by item 3 of Theorem 1.  For _n_=_n_<sub>1</sub>, condition (iv) is maintained by noting that the degree-_n_<sub>1</sub> polynomial's Bernstein coefficients must be bounded by 0 and 1 by condition (i) so they will likewise be bounded by those of the lower and upper polynomials of degree less than _n_<sub>1</sub>, and those polynomials are the constant 0 and the constant 1, respectively, as are their Bernstein coefficients. Finally, for $n$ other than a power of 2, defining $g_n = g_{n-1}$ and $h_n = h_{n-1}$ maintains condition (iv) by Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1].  &#x25a1;

> **Note:** The last condition of Proposition 3, condition (ii), says **fabove**(_n_, _k_)\*choose(_n_,_k_) and **fbelow**(_n_, _k_)\*choose(_n_,_k_) must be integers. [^29] But Proposition 3 assumes only the biased coin and no other randomness is used, and that the coin doesn't show heads every time or tails every time.  Therefore, _f_(0), if it exists, must be an integer, and the same is true for _f_(1), so that condition (ii) is redundant with condition (iii) due to a result that goes back to Kantorovich (1931)[^30]; see also Remark C of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1].

**Corollary 1.** _Let f(&lambda;) be a strictly bounded factory function. If that function is Hölder continuous with Hölder constant M and Hölder exponent $\alpha$, then the following scheme determined by **fbelow** and **fabove** is valid in the sense of Theorem 1:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) = f(k/n) &minus; D(n)._
- _**fabove**(n, k) = f(k/n) + D(n)._

_Where_ $D(n)=\frac{M}{((2^{\alpha/2}-1) n^{\alpha/2}}$.

_Or:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) = min(**fbelow**(4,0), **fbelow**(4,1), ..., **fbelow**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(k/n) &minus; &eta;(n)._
- _**fabove**(n, k) = max(**fabove**(4,0), **fabove**(4,1), ..., **fabove**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(k/n) + &eta;(n)._

_Where $\eta(n)=M(2/7)^{\alpha-2}/((2^{\alpha/2}-1)n^{\alpha/2})$._

_Proof._ Because $f$ is Hölder continuous, it admits the modulus of continuity $\omega(x)=Mx^{\alpha}$.  By part 1 of lemma 2:

- For each integer $n\ge 1$ that's a power of 2 ($n_0=1$ in Theorem 1), $\phi(n)=\omega(\sqrt{1/(2n)})=M (1/(2n))^{\alpha/2}$ can be taken for each such integer $n$, and thus $\eta(n)=D(n)=\frac{M}{((2^{\alpha/2}-1) n^{\alpha/2}}$ (where $\eta(n)$ is as in Theorem 1).
- For each integer $n\ge 4$ that's a power of 2 ($n_0=4$ in Theorem 1), $\phi(n)=\omega(\sqrt{1/(2n)})=M (1/(7n))^{\alpha/2}$ can be taken for each such integer $n$, and thus $\eta(n)=$ M\*(2/7)$^{\alpha/2}$/((2$^{\alpha/2}$&minus;1)\*n$^{\alpha/2}$).

In both cases $\eta(n)$ is finite and converges to 0 as $n$ increases.

The result then follows from Theorem 1. &#x25a1;

> **Note:** For specific values of _&alpha;_, the equation _D_(_n_) = _D_(2 \* _n_) + _&phi;_(_n_) can be solved via linear recurrences; an example for _&alpha;_ = 1/2 is the following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library: `alpha=(S(1)/2); rsolve(Eq(f(n), f(n+1)+z*(1/(2*2**n))**(alpha/2)), f(n)).subs(n,ln(n,2)).simplify()`.  Trying different values of _&alpha;_ suggested the following formula for Hölder continuous functions with _&alpha;_ of 1/_j_ or greater: (_M_\* $\sum_{i=0}^{2j-1} 2^{i/(2j)}$)/_n_<sup>1/(2\*_j_)</sup> = _M_ / ((2<sup>1/(2\*_j_)</sup>&minus;1)\*_n_<sup>1/(2\*_j_)</sup>); and generalizing the latter expression led to the term in the theorem.

**Corollary 2.** _Let f(&lambda;) be a strictly bounded factory function.  If that function is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant M, then the following scheme determined by **fbelow** and **fabove** is valid in the sense of Theorem 1:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) = f(k/n) &minus; M/((sqrt(2)&minus;1)\*sqrt(n))._
- _**fabove**(n, k) = f(k/n) + M/((sqrt(2)&minus;1)\*sqrt(n))._

_Or:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) = min(**fbelow**(4,0), **fbelow**(4,1), ..., **fbelow**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(k/n) &minus; M\*sqrt(2/7)/((sqrt(2)&minus;1)\*sqrt(n))._
- _**fabove**(n, k) = max(**fabove**(4,0), **fabove**(4,1), ..., **fabove**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(k/n) + M\*sqrt(2/7)/((sqrt(2)&minus;1)\*sqrt(n))._

_Proof._ Because Lipschitz continuous functions are Hölder continuous with Hölder constant _M_ and exponent 1, the result follows from Corollary 1. &#x25a1;

> **Note:** The first scheme given here is a special case of Theorem 1 that was already found by Nacu and Peres (2005\)[^1].

**Corollary 3.** _Let f(&lambda;) be a strictly bounded factory function. If that function has a Lipschitz continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant L, then the following scheme determined by **fbelow** and **fabove** is valid in the sense of Theorem 1:_

- _**fbelow**(n, k) = min(**fbelow**(4,0), **fbelow**(4,1), ..., **fbelow**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(k/n) &minus; L/(7\*n)._
- _**fabove**(n, k) = max(**fabove**(4,0), **fabove**(4,1), ..., **fabove**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(k/n) + L/(7\*n)._

_Proof._ By part 3 of lemma 2, for each integer $n\ge 4$ that's a power of 2 ($n_0=4$ in Theorem 1), $\phi(n)=(L/2) (1/(7n))$ can be taken for each such integer $n$, and thus $\eta(n)=L/(7n)$ (where $\eta(n)$ is as in Theorem 1). $\eta(n)$ is finite and converges to 0 as $n$ increases. The result then follows from Theorem 1. &#x25a1;

> **Note:** Nacu and Peres (2005\)[^1] already proved a looser scheme in the case when $f$ has a second derivative on the closed unit interval that is not greater than a constant \(a slightly stronger condition than having a Lipschitz continuous derivative on that domain).

**Theorem 2.** _Let f(&lambda;) be a strictly bounded factory function.  If that function is convex and nowhere decreasing, then Theorem 1 remains valid with &phi;(n) = **E**\[f(Y/n)\] (where Y is a hypergeometric(2*n, n, n) random variable), rather than as given in that theorem._

_Proof._  Follows from Theorem 1 and part 4 of Lemma 2 above. With the _&phi;_ given in this theorem, the series _&eta;_(_n_) in Theorem 1 remains nonnegative; also, this theorem adopts Theorem 1's assumption that the series converges, so that _&eta;_(_n_) still decreases with increasing _n_. &#x25a1;

**Proposition 1.**

1. _Let f be as given in Theorem 1 or 2 or Corollary 1 to 3, except that f must be concave and polynomially bounded and may have a minimum of 0. Then the schemes of those results remain valid if **fbelow**(n, k) = f(k/n), rather than as given in those results._
2. _Let f be as given in Theorem 1 or 2 or Corollary 1 to 3, except that f must be convex and polynomially bounded and may have a maximum of 1.  Then the schemes of those results remain valid if **fabove**(n, k) = f(k/n), rather than as given in those results._
3. _Theorems 1 and 2 and Corollaries 1 to 3 can be extended to all integers n&ge;1, not just those that are powers of 2, by defining&mdash;_

    - _**fbelow**(n, k) = (k/n)\***fbelow**(n&minus;1, max(0, k&minus;1)) + ((n&minus;k)/n)\***fbelow**(n&minus;1, min(n&minus;1, k)), and_
    - _**fabove**(n, k) = (k/n)\***fabove**(n&minus;1, max(0, k&minus;1)) + ((n&minus;k)/n)\***fabove**(n&minus;1, min(n&minus;1, k)),_

    _for every integer n&ge;1 other than a power of 2. Parts 1 and 2 of this proposition still apply to the modified scheme._

_Proof._ Parts 1 and 2 follow from Theorem 1 or 2 or Corollary 1 to 3, as the case may be.  For part 1, the lower polynomials are replaced by the degree-_n_ Bernstein polynomials of _f_, and they meet the conditions in those theorems by Jensen's inequality.  For part 2, the upper polynomials are involved instead of the lower polynomials.  Part 3 also follows from Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005\)[^1]. &#x25a1;

The following lemma shows that if a scheme for $f(\lambda)$ shifts polynomials upward and downward, the pre-shifted polynomials are close to $f(\lambda)$ by the amount of the shift.

**Lemma 3.** _Let $f$ be a strictly bounded factory function. Let $S$ be an infinite set of positive integers.  For each integer $n\ge 1$, let $W_n(\lambda)$ be a function, and let $\epsilon_n(f)$ be a nonnegative constant that depends on $f$ and $n$.  Suppose that there are polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ (for each $n$ in $S$) as follows:_

1. _$g_n$ and $h_n$ have Bernstein coefficients $W_n(k/n) - \epsilon_n(f)$ and $W_n(k/n) + \epsilon_n(f)$, respectively ($0\le k\le n$)._
2. _$g_n \le h_n$._
3. _$g_n$ and $h_n$ converge to $f$ as $n$ gets large._
4. $(g_{m}-g_n)$ _and_ $(h_{n}-h_{m})$ _are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once they are rewritten to polynomials in Bernstein form of degree exactly $m$, where $m$ is the smallest number greater than $n$ in $S$._

_Then for each $n$ in $S$, $\text{abs}(f(\lambda) - B_n(W_n(\lambda))) \le \epsilon_n(f)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, where $B_n(W_n(\lambda))$ is the Bernstein polynomial of degree $n$ of the function $W_n(\lambda)$._

_Proof:_ $W_n(k/n)$ is the $k$-th Bernstein coefficient of $B_n(W_n(\lambda))$, which is $g_n$ and $h_n$ before they are shifted downward and upward, respectively, by $\epsilon_n(f)$.  Moreover, property 4 in the lemma corresponds to condition (iv) of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1], which implies that, for every $m>n$, $g_{n}(\lambda)\le g_{m}(\lambda)\le f(\lambda)$ (the lower polynomials "increase") and $h_{n}(\lambda)\ge h_{m}(\lambda)\ge f(\lambda)$ (the upper polynomials "decrease") for every $n\ge 1$ (Nacu and Peres 2005, Remark A)[^1].

Then if $B_n(W_n(\lambda)) < f(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda$ in the closed unit interval, shifting the left-hand side upward by $\epsilon_n(f)$ (a nonnegative constant) means that $h_n = B_n(W_n(\lambda))+\epsilon_n(f) \ge f(\lambda)$, and rearranging this expression leads to $f(\lambda) - B_n(W_n(\lambda)) \le \epsilon_n(f)$.

Likewise, if $B_n(W_n(\lambda)) > f(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda$ in the closed unit interval, shifting the left-hand side downward by $\epsilon_n(f)$ means that $g_n = B_n(W_n(\lambda))-\epsilon_n(f) \le f(\lambda)$, and rearranging this expression leads to $B_n(W_n(\lambda)) - f(\lambda) \le \epsilon_n(f)$.

This combined means that $\text{abs}(f(x) - B_n(W_n(\lambda))) \le \epsilon_n(f)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$.  &#x25a1;

**Corollary 4**.  _If $f(\lambda)$ satisfies a scheme given in Theorem 1 with $n_0\ge 1$, then $B_n(f(\lambda))$ comes within $\eta(n)$ of $f$ for every integer $n\ge n_0$ that's a power of 2; that is, $\text{abs}(B_n(f(\lambda))) \le \eta(n)$ for every such $n$._

**Lemma 5**. Let $n\ge 1$ be an integer.  Suppose $g_{2n}$ and $g_{n}$ are polynomials in Bernstein form of degree $2n$ and $n$, respectively, and their domain is the closed unit interval. Suppose $g_{2n}$ and $g_n$ satisfy the property:

- $(g_{2n}-g_n)$ is a polynomial with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once it is rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$.

Then for every $x\ge 0$, $g_{2n}+x$ and $g_n$ satisfy that property, and for every $x\ge 1$, $g_{2n}\cdot x$ and $g_n$ do as well.

The proof follows from two well-known properties of polynomials in Bernstein form: adding $x$ to $g_{2n}$ amounts to adding $x$ to its Bernstein coefficients, and multiplying $g_{2n}$ by $x$ amounts to multiplying its Bernstein coefficients by $x$.  In either case, $g_{2n}$'s Bernstein coefficients become no less than they otherwise would, so that $(g_{2n}-g_n)$ continues to have nonnegative Bernstein coefficients as required by the property.

It is also true that, for every $x\ge 0$, $g_{2n}\cdot x$ and $g_n\cdot x$ satisfy the same property, but a detailed proof of this is left as an exercise to anyone interested. (If $x=0$, $g_n\cdot x=g_{2n}\cdot x=0$, so that the property is trivially satisfied.)

Finally, it is true that, for every real number $x$, $g_{2n}+x$ and $g_n+x$ satisfy the same property, but, again, a detailed proof of this is left as an exercise to anyone interested. (If $x=0$, $g_n+x=g_n$ and $g_{2n}+x=g_{2n}$, so that the property is trivially satisfied.)

<a id=A_Conjecture_on_Polynomial_Approximation></a>

#### A Conjecture on Polynomial Approximation

The following conjecture suggests there may be a way to easily adapt other approximating polynomials, besides the ordinary Bernstein polynomials, to the Bernoulli factory problem.

**Conjecture.**

Let $r\ge 1$, and let $f$ be a strictly bounded factory function whose $r$-th derivative is continuous.  Let $M$ be the maximum of the absolute value of $f$ and its derivatives up to the $r$-th derivative. Let $W_{2^0}(\lambda), W_{2^1}(\lambda), ..., W_{2^n}(\lambda),...$ be functions on the closed unit interval that converge uniformly to $f$ (that is, for every tolerance level, all $W_{2^i}$ after some value $i$ are within that tolerance level of $f$ at all points on the closed unit interval).

For each integer $n\ge1$ that's a power of 2, suppose that there is $D>0$ such that&mdash;

$$\text{abs}(f(\lambda)-B_n(W_n(\lambda))) \le DM/n^{r/2},$$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, where $B_n(W_n(\lambda))$ is the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomial of $W_n(\lambda)$.

Then there is $C_0\ge D$ such that for every $C\ge C_0$, there are polynomials $g_n$ (for each $n\ge 1$) as follows:

1. $g_n$ has Bernstein coefficients $W_n(k/n) - CM/n^{r/2}$ ($0\le k\le n$), if $n$ is a power of 2, and $g_n=g_{n-1}$ otherwise.
2. $g_n$ converges to $f$ as $n$ gets large.
3. $(g_{n+1}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once it is rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $n+1$.

Equivalently (see also Nacu and Peres 2005), there is $C_1>0$ such that, for each integer $n\ge 1$ that's a power of 2&mdash;

$$\left(\text{abs}(\left(\sum_{i=0}^k W_n\left(\frac{i}{n}\right) \sigma_{n,k,i}\right)-W_{2n}\left(\frac{k}{2n}\right)\right)\le \frac{C_1 M}{n^{r/2}},\tag{PB}$$

whenever $0\le k\le 2n$, so that $C=\frac{C_1}{1-\sqrt{2/2^{r+1}}}$.  Here, $\sigma_{n,k,i} = {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n \choose k}$ is the probability that a hypergeometric(2\*_n_, _k_, _n_) random variable equals _i_.

It is further conjectured that the same value of $C_0$ (or $C_1$) suffices when $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous $(r-1)$-th derivative and $M$ is the maximum of the absolute value of $f$ and the Lipschitz constants of $f$ and its derivatives up to the $(r-1)$-th derivative.

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. If $W_n(0)=f(0)$ and $W_n(1)=f(1)$ for every $n$, then (PB) is automatically true when $k=0$ and $k=2n$, so that the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\lt 2n$.  If, in addition, $W_n$ is symmetric about 1/2, so that $W_n(\lambda)=W_n(1-\lambda)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, then the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\le n$ (since the values $\sigma_{n,k,i}$ are symmetric in that they satisfy $\sigma_{n,k,i}=\sigma_{n,k,k-i}$).
> 2. If $W_n$ is a "linear operator", the left-hand side of (PB) is not greater than $\text{abs}((\sum_{i=0}^k (W_n(\frac{i}{n}))\sigma_{n,k,i})-W_{n}(k/(2n)))$ + $\text{abs}(W_n(k/(2n))-f(k/(2n)))$  + $\text{abs}(W_{2n}(k/(2n))-f(k/(2n)))$.
> 3. If $W_n$ is a "linear operator" and satisfies $\text{abs}(f(\lambda)-W_n(\lambda))\le DM/n^{r/2}$, then the left-hand side of (PB) is not greater than $\text{abs}((\sum_{i=0}^k (W_n(\frac{i}{n}))\sigma_{n,k,i})-W_{n}(k/(2n)))$ + $\frac{DM(2^{r/2}+1)}{2^{r/2}}\frac{1}{n^{r/2}}$.
> 3. By Lemma 3, $B_n(W_n(f(\lambda)))$ would be close to $f(\lambda)$ by at most $C_0 M/n^{r/2}$.  Properties 2 and 3 above correspond to (iii) and (iv) in Nacu and Peres (2005, Proposition 3\)[^1].

---------------------

The following lower bounds on $C_0$, given certain polynomials, can be shown.  In the table:

- $M_{r}$ is the maximum of the absolute value of $f(\lambda)$ and its derivatives up to the $r$-th derivative.
- The bounds are valid only if $n$ is a power-of-two integer and, unless otherwise specified, only if $n\ge 1$.

#### Example of Polynomial-Building Scheme

The following example uses the results above to build a polynomial-building scheme for a factory function.

Let _f_(_&lambda;_) = 0 if _&lambda;_ is 0, and (ln(_&lambda;_/exp(3)))<sup>&minus;2</sup> otherwise. (This function is not Hölder continuous; its slope is exponentially steep at the point 0.)  Then the following scheme is valid in the sense of Theorem 1:

- _&eta;_(_k_) = &Phi;(1, 2, (ln(_k_)+ln(7)+6)/ln(2))\*4/ln(2)<sup>2</sup>.
- **fbelow**(n, k) = f(_k_/_n_).
- **fabove**(n, k) = max(**fabove**(4,0), **fabove**(4,1), ..., **fabove**(4,4)) if n < 4; otherwise, f(_k_/_n_) +  _&eta;_(_n_).

Where &Phi;(.) is a function called the _Lerch transcendent_.

The first step is to find a concave modulus of continuity of _f_ (called _&omega;_(_h_)).  Because _f_ is strictly increasing and concave, and because _f_(0) = 0, _&omega;_(_h_) = _f_(_h_) can be taken for _&omega;_.

Now, plugging sqrt(1/(7\*_n_)) into _&omega;_ leads to the following for Theorem 2 (assuming _n_&ge;0):

- _&phi;_(_n_) = 1/(ln(sqrt(7/_n_)/7)&minus;3)<sup>2</sup>.

Now, by applying Theorem 1, compute _&eta;_(_k_) by substituting _n_ with 2<sup>_n_</sup>, summing over [_k_, &infin;), and substituting _k_ with ln(_k_)/ln(2).  _&eta;_ converges, resulting in:

- _&eta;_(_k_) = &Phi;(1, 2, (ln(_k_)+ln(7)+6)/ln(2))\*4/ln(2)<sup>2</sup>,

where &Phi;(.) is the Lerch transcendent.  This _&eta;_ matches the _&eta;_ given in the scheme above.  That scheme then follows from Theorems 1 and 2, as well as from part 1 of Proposition 1 because _f_ is concave.

the following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library is an example of finding the parameters for this polynomial-building scheme.

```
px=Piecewise((0,Eq(x,0)),((ln(x/exp(3))**-2),True))
# omega is modulus of continuity.  Since
# px is strictly increasing, concave, and px(0)=0,
# take omega as px
omega=px
omega=piecewise_fold(omega.rewrite(Piecewise)).simplify()
# compute omega
phi=omega.subs(x,sqrt(1/(7*n)))
pprint(phi)
# compute eta
eta=summation(phi.subs(n,2**n),(n,k,oo)).simplify()
eta=eta.subs(k,log(k,2)) # Replace k with ln(k)/ln(2)
pprint(eta)
for i in range(20):
  # Calculate upper bounds for eta at certain points.
  try:
    print("eta(2^%d) ~= %s" % (i,ceiling(eta.subs(k,2**i)*10000000).n()/10000000))
  except:
    print("eta(2^%d) ~= [FAILED]" % (i))
```

### Which functions don't require outside randomness to simulate?

The function _f_(_&lambda;_) is _strongly simulable_ if it admits a Bernoulli factory algorithm that uses nothing but the input coin as a source of randomness (Keane and O'Brien 1994\)[^22].  See "[**Randomized vs. Non-Randomized Algorithms**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Randomized_vs_Non_Randomized_Algorithms)".

**Strong Simulability Statement.** A function _f_(_&lambda;_) is strongly simulable only if&mdash;

1. _f_ is constant on its domain, or is continuous and polynomially bounded on its domain, and
2. _f_ maps the closed unit interval or a subset of it to the closed unit interval, and
3. _f_(0) equals 0 or 1 whenever 0 is in the domain of _f_, and
4. _f_(1) equals 0 or 1 whenever 1 is in the domain of _f_.

Keane and O'Brien already showed that _f_ is strongly simulable if conditions 1 and 2 are true and neither 0 nor 1 are included in the domain of _f_.  Conditions 3 and 4 are required because _&lambda;_ (the probability of heads) can be 0 or 1 so that the input coin returns 0 or 1, respectively, every time.  This is called a "degenerate" coin.  When given just a degenerate coin, no algorithm can produce one value with probability greater than 0, and another value with the opposite probability.  Rather, the algorithm can only produce a constant value with probability 1.  In the Bernoulli factory problem, that constant is either 0 or 1, so a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _f_ must return 1 with probability 1, or 0 with probability 1, when given just a degenerate coin and no outside randomness, resulting in conditions 3 and 4.

To show that _f_ is strongly simulable, it's enough to show that there is a Bernoulli factory for _f_ that must flip the input coin and get 0 and 1 before it uses any outside randomness.

**Proposition 1.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and is a polynomial with computable Bernstein coefficients, it is strongly simulable._

_Proof:_ If _f_ is the constant 0 or 1, the proof is trivial: simply return 0 or 1, respectively.

Otherwise: Let _a_\[_j_\] be the _j_<sup>th</sup> Bernstein coefficient of the polynomial in Bernstein form.  Consider the following algorithm, modified from (Goyal and Sigman 2012\)[^7].

1. Flip the input coin _n_ times, and let _j_ be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way.
2. If 0 is in the domain of _f_ and if _j_ is 0, return _f_(0). (By condition 3, _f_(0) must be either 0 or 1.)
3. If 1 is in the domain of _f_ and if _j_ is _n_, return _f_(1). (By condition 4, _f_(1) must be either 0 or 1.)
4. With probability _a_\[_j_\], return 1.  Otherwise, return 0. (For example, generate a uniformly distributed random variate, greater than 0 and less than 1, then return 1 if that variate is less than _a_\[_j_\], or 0 otherwise.  _a_\[_j_\] is the Bernstein coefficient _j_ of the polynomial written in Bernstein form), or 0 otherwise.

(By the properties of the Bernstein form, _a_\[0\] will equal _f_(0) and _a_\[_n_\] will equal _f_(1) whenever 0 or 1 is in the domain of _f_, respectively.)

Step 4 is done by first generating fair coin flips (such as with the von Neumann trick of flipping the input coin twice until the flip returns 0 then 1 or 1 then 0 this way, then taking the result as 0 or 1, respectively (von Neumann 1951\)[^31]), then using the algorithm in "[**Digit Expansions**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Digit_Expansion)" to produce the probability _a_\[_j_\].  The algorithm computes _a_\[_j_\] bit by bit and compares the computed value with the generated bits.  Since the coin returned both 0 and 1 in step 1 earlier in the algorithm, we know the coin isn't degenerate, so that step 4 will finish with probability 1.  Now, since the Bernoulli factory used only the input coin for randomness, this shows that _f_ is strongly simulable. &#x25a1;

**Proposition 2.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement, and if either f is constant on its domain or f meets the additional conditions below, then f is strongly simulable._

1. _If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 0 or both, then there is a polynomial g(&lambda;) whose Bernstein coefficients are computable and in the closed unit interval, such that g(0) = f(0) and g(1) = f(1) whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that g(&lambda;) &gt; f(&lambda;) for every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1._
2. _If f(0) = 1 or f(1) = 1 or both, then there is a polynomial h(&lambda;) whose Bernstein coefficients are computable and in the closed unit interval, such that h(0) = f(0) and h(1) = f(1) whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that h(&lambda;) &lt; f(&lambda;) for every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1._

**Lemma 1.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and meets the additional condition below, then f is strongly simulable._

- _There is a polynomial g(&lambda;) whose Bernstein coefficients are computable and in the closed unit interval, such that g(0) = f(0) and g(1) = f(1) whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that g(&lambda;) &gt; f(&lambda;) for every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1._

_Proof:_  Consider the following algorithm.

1. If _f_ is 0 everywhere in its domain or 1 everywhere in its domain, return 0 or 1, respectively.
2. Otherwise, use the algorithm given in Proposition 1 to simulate _g_(_&lambda;_).  If the algorithm returns 0, return 0. By the additional condition in the lemma, 0 will be returned if _&lambda;_ is either 0 or 1.

    Now, we know that the input coin's probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1.

    By the conditions in the lemma, both _f_(_&lambda;_)>0 and _g_(_&lambda;_)>0 whenever 0 < _&lambda;_ < 1 and _&lambda;_ is in _f_'s domain.

    Now let _h_(_&lambda;_) = _f_(_&lambda;_)/_g_(_&lambda;_).  By the conditions in the lemma, _h_ will be positive everywhere in that interval.

3. Return 1 if _h_ has the following property: _h_(_&lambda;_) = 0 whenever 0 < _&lambda;_ < 1 and _&lambda;_ is in _f_'s domain.
4. Otherwise, we run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _h_(_&lambda;_) that uses the input coin (and possibly outside randomness).  Since _h_ is continuous and polynomially bounded and the input coin's probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1, _h_ is strongly simulable; the von Neumann trick lets the input coin serve as a fair coin, thus doing away with outside randomness in the algorithm.

Thus, _f_ admits an algorithm that uses nothing but the input coin as a source of randomness, and so is strongly simulable. &#x25a1;

**Lemma 2.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and meets the additional conditions below, then f is strongly simulable._

1. _There are two polynomials g(&lambda;) and &omega;(&lambda;) such that both polynomials' Bernstein coefficients are computable and all in the closed unit interval._
2. _g(0) = &omega;(0) = f(0) = 0 (so that 0 is in the domain of f)._
3. _g(1) = &omega;(1) = f(1) = 1 (so that 1 is in the domain of f)._
4. _For every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1, g(&lambda;) &gt; f(&lambda;)._
5. _For every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1, &omega;(&lambda;) &lt; f(&lambda;)._

_Proof:_ First, assume _g_ and _&omega;_ have the same degree.  If not, rewrite the the polynomial with lesser degree to a polynomial in Bernstein form with the same degree as the other polynomial.

Now, let _g_\[_j_\] and _&omega;_\[_j_\] be the _j_<sup>th</sup> Bernstein coefficient of the polynomial _g_ or _&omega;_, respectively.  Consider the following algorithm, which is similar to the algorithm in Proposition 1.

1. Flip the input coin _n_ times, and let _j_ be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way.
2. If 0 is in the domain of _f_ and if _j_ is 0, return _g_(0) = _&omega;_(0) = 0.
3. If 1 is in the domain of _f_ and if _j_ is _n_, return _g_(1) = _&omega;_(1) = 0.
4. Generate a uniformly distributed random variate, greater than 0 and less than 1, then return 1 if that variate is less than _&omega;_\[_j_\], or return 0 if that variate is greater than _g_\[_j_\].  This step is carried out via the von Neumann method, as in Proposition 1.

If the algorithm didn't return a value, then by now we know that the input coin's probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1, since step 2 returned a value (either 0 or 1), which can only happen if the input coin didn't return all zeros or all ones.

Now let _r_(_&lambda;_) = (_f_(_&lambda;_) &minus; _&omega;_(_&lambda;_)) / (_g_(_&lambda;_) &minus; _&omega;_(_&lambda;_)).  By the conditions in the lemma, _h_(_&lambda;_) will be positive wherever 0 < _&lambda;_ < 1 and _&lambda;_ is in the domain of _f_.

Now, run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for _r_(_&lambda;_) that uses the input coin (and possibly outside randomness).  Since _r_ is continuous and polynomially bounded and the input coin's probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1, _r_ is strongly simulable; the von Neumann trick lets the input coin serve as a fair coin, thus doing away with outside randomness in the algorithm.

Thus, _f_ admits an algorithm that uses nothing but the input coin as a source of randomness, and so is strongly simulable. &#x25a1;

_Proof of Proposition 2:_  The following cases can occur:

1. If neither 0 nor 1 are in the domain of _f_, then _f_ is strongly simulable by the discussion above.
2. If _f_ is 0 everywhere in its domain or 1 everywhere in its domain: Return 0 or 1, respectively.
3. If 0 but not 1 is in the domain of _f_: If _f_(0) = 0, apply Lemma 1.  If _f_(0) = 1, apply Lemma 1, but take _f_ = 1 &minus; _f_ and return 1 minus the output of the lemma's algorithm (this will bring _f_(0) = 0 and satisfy the lemma.)
4. If 1 but not 0 is in the domain of _f_: If _f_(1) = 0, apply Lemma 1.  If _f_(1) = 1, apply Lemma 1, but take _f_ = 1 &minus; _f_ and return 1 minus the output of the lemma's algorithm (this will bring _f_(1) = 0 and satisfy the lemma.)
5. _f_(0) = _f_(1) = 0: Apply Lemma 1.
6. _f_(0) = _f_(1) = 1: Apply Lemma 1, but take _f_ = 1 &minus; _f_ and return 1 minus the output of the lemma's algorithm.
7. _f_(0) = 0 and _f_(1) = 1: Apply Lemma 2.
8. _f_(0) = 1 and _f_(1) = 0: Apply Lemma 2, but take _f_ = 1 &minus; _f_ and return 1 minus the output of the lemma's algorithm.

&#x25a1;

**Proposition 3.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and is Lipschitz continuous, then f is strongly simulable._

**Lemma 3.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement, is Lipschitz continuous, and is such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 0 whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, then f is strongly simulable._

_Proof:_ If _f_ is 0 everywhere in its domain or 1 everywhere in its domain: Return 0 or 1, respectively.  Otherwise, let&mdash;

- _M_ be the Lipschitz constant of _f_ (its derivative's maximum of the absolute value if _f_ is continuous), or a computable number greater than this.

- _l_ be either 0 if 0 is in the domain of _f_, or 1 otherwise, and
- _u_ be either 0 if 1 is in the domain of _f_, or 1 otherwise.

To build _g_, take its degree as ceil(_M_)+1 or greater (so that _g_'s Lipschitz constant is greater than _M_ and _g_ has ceil(_M_) + 2 Bernstein coefficients), then set the first Bernstein coefficient as _l_, the last one as _u_, and the remaining ones as 1. (As a result, the polynomial _g_ will have computable Bernstein coefficients.) Then _g_ will meet the additional condition for Lemma 1 and the result follows from that lemma. &#x25a1;

**Lemma 4.** _If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement, is Lipschitz continuous, and is such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1 (so that 0 and 1 are in the domain of f), then f is strongly simulable._

_Proof:_ Let _M_ and _l_ be as in Lemma 3.

To build _g_ and _&omega;_, take their degree as ceil(_M_)+1 or greater (so that their Lipschitz constant is greater than _M_ and each polynomial has ceil(_M_) + 2 Bernstein coefficients), then for each polynomial, set its first Bernstein coefficient as _l_ and its last as 1. The remaining Bernstein coefficients of _g_ are set as 1 and the remaining ones of _&omega;_ are set as 0.  (As a result, the polynomial _g_ will have computable Bernstein coefficients.)  Then _g_ and _&omega;_ will meet the additional conditions for Lemma 2 and the result follows from that lemma. &#x25a1;

_Proof of Proposition 3:_ In the proof of proposition 2, replace Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 with Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, respectively. &#x25a1;

**Conjecture 1**. _The conditions of Proposition 2 are necessary for $f(\lambda)$ to be strongly simulable._

A condition such as "0 is not in the domain of $f$, or there is a number $\epsilon>0$ and a Lipschitz continuous function $g(x)$ on the interval $0\le x \lt \epsilon$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ whenever $x$ is in both $g$'s and $f$'s domains" does not work.  An example that shows this is $f(x)=(\sin(1/x)/4+1/2)\cdot(1-(1-x)^n)$ for $n\ge 1$ (and $f(0)=0$), which is strongly simulable at 0 even though the condition just quoted is not satisfied for $f$.  ($(1-x)^n$ is the probability of the biased coin showing zero $n$ times in a row.)

### Multiple-Output Bernoulli Factory

A related topic is a Bernoulli factory that takes a coin with unknown probability of heads _&lambda;_ and produces one or more samples of the probability _f_(_&lambda;_).  This section calls it a _multiple-output Bernoulli factory_.

Obviously, any single-output Bernoulli factory can produce multiple outputs by running itself multiple times.  But for some functions _f_, it may be that producing multiple outputs at a time may use fewer input coin flips than producing one output multiple times.

Let _a_ and _b_ be real numbers satisfying 0 < _a_ < _b_ < 1, such as _a_=1/100, _b_=99/100.  Define the _entropy bound_ as _h_(_f_(_&lambda;_))/_h_(_&lambda;_) where _h_(_x_) = &minus;_x_\*ln(_x_)&minus;(1&minus;_x_)\*ln(1&minus;_x_) is related to the Shannon entropy function.  The question is:

_When the probability &lambda; is such that a &le; &lambda; &le; b, is there a multiple-output Bernoulli factory for f(&lambda;) with an expected ("long-run average") number of input coin flips per sample that is arbitrarily close to the entropy bound?  Call such a Bernoulli factory an **optimal factory**._

(See Nacu and Peres (2005, Question 2\)[^1].)

So far, the following functions do admit an _optimal factory_:

- The functions _&lambda;_ and 1 &minus; _&lambda;_.
- Constants _c_ satisfying 0 &le; _c_ &le; 1.  As Nacu and Peres (2005\)[^1] already showed, any such constant admits an optimal factory: turn flips of the input coin into _fair coin flips_ (numbers that each equal 1 or 0 with equal probability) using Peres's iterated von Neumann extractor (Peres 1992\)[^32], then build a binary tree that generates 1 with probability _c_ and 0 otherwise (Knuth and Yao 1976\)[^33].

It is easy to see that if an _optimal factory_ exists for _f_(_&lambda;_), then one also exists for 1 &minus; _f_(_&lambda;_): simply change all ones returned by the _f_(_&lambda;_) factory into zeros and vice versa.

Also, as Yuval Peres (Jun. 24, 2021) told me, there is an efficient multiple-output Bernoulli factory for _f_(_&lambda;_) = _&lambda;_/2: the key is to flip the input coin enough times to produce fair coin flips using his extractor (Peres 1992\)[^14], then multiply each fair coin flip with another input coin flip to get a sample from _&lambda;_/2.  Given that the sample is equal to 0, there are three possibilities that can "be extracted to produce more fair bits": either the fair coin flip is 0, or the coin flip is 0, or both are 0.

This algorithm, though, doesn't count as an _optimal factory_, and Peres described this algorithm only incompletely.  By simulation and trial and error I found an improved version of the algorithm.  It uses two randomness extractors (extractor 1 and extractor 2) that produce fair coin flips from bits that are not necessarily from fair coin flips (which is done using a method given later in this section).  The extractors must be asymptotically optimal (they must approach the entropy limit as closely as desired); one example is the iterated von Neumann construction in Peres (1992\)[^32].  The algorithm consists of doing the following in a loop until the desired number of outputs is generated.

1. If the number of outputs generated so far is divisible by 20, do the following:
    - Generate a fair coin using the method given later in this section.  If that bit is zero, output 0, then repeat this step unless the desired number of outputs has been generated.  If the bit is 1, flip the input coin and output the result.
2. Otherwise, do the following:
    1. Generate a fair coin using the method given later in this section, call it _fc_.  Then flip the input coin and call the result _bc_.
    2. Output _fc_\*_bc_.
    3. (The following steps pass "unused" randomness to the extractor in a specific way to ensure correctness.) If _fc_ is 0, and _bc_ is 1, append 0 to extractor 2's input bits.
    4. If _fc_ and _bc_ are both 0, append 1 then 1 to extractor 2's input bits.
    5. If _fc_ is 1 and _bc_ is 0, append 1 then 0 to extractor 2's input bits.

Inspired by Peres's result with _&lambda;_/2, the following algorithm is proposed.  It works for every function writable as _D_(_&lambda;_)/_E_(_&lambda;_), where&mdash;

- $D$ is the polynomial $D(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^k \lambda^i (1-\lambda)^{k-i} d[i]$,
- $E$ is the polynomial $E(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^k \lambda^i (1-\lambda)^{k-i} e[i]$,
- every _d_\[_i_\] is less than or equal to the corresponding _e_\[_i_\], and
- each _d_\[_i_\] and each _e_\[_i_\] is a nonnegative integer.

The algorithm is a modified version of the "block simulation" in Mossel and Peres (2005, Proposition 2.5\)[^34], which also "extracts" residual randomness with the help of six asymptotically optimal randomness extractors.  In the algorithm, let _r_ be an integer such that, for every integer _i_ in \[0, _k_], _e_\[_i_\] < choose(_k_, _i_)\*choose(2\*_r_, _r_).

1. Set _iter_ to 0.
2. Flip the input coin _k_ times.  Then build a bitstring _B1_ consisting of the coin flip results in the order they occurred.  Let _i_ be the number of ones in _B1_.
3. Generate 2\*_r_ a fair coin using the method given later in this section.  (Rather than flipping the input coin 2\*_r_ times, as in the algorithm of Proposition 2.5.)  Then build a bitstring _B2_ consisting of the coin flip results in the order they occurred.
4. If the number of ones in _B2_ is other than _r_: Translate _B1_ + _B2_ to an integer under mapping 1, then pass that number to extractor 2 (&dagger;), then add 1 to _iter_, then go to step 2.
5. Translate _B1_ + _B2_ to an integer under mapping 2, call the integer _&beta;_.  If _&beta;_ < _d_\[_i_\], pass _&beta;_ to extractor 3, then pass _iter_ to extractor 6, then give out a 1.  Otherwise, if _&beta;_ < _e_\[_i_\], pass _&beta;_ &minus; _d_\[_i_\] to extractor 4, then pass _iter_ to extractor 6, then give out a 0.  Otherwise, pass _&beta;_ &minus; _e_\[_i_\] to extractor 5, then add 1 to _iter_, then go to step 2.

The mappings used in this algorithm are as follows:

1. A one-to-one mapping between&mdash;
    - bitstrings of length _k_ + 2\*_r_ with fewer or greater than _r_ ones among the last 2\*_r_ bits, and
    - the integers in [0, 2<sup>_k_</sup> \* (2<sup>2\*_r_</sup> &minus; choose(2\*_r_, _r_))).
2. A one-to-one mapping between&mdash;
    - bitstrings of length _k_ + 2\*_r_ with exactly _i_ ones among the first _k_ bits and exactly _r_ ones among the remaining bits, and
    - the integers in [0, choose(_k_, _i_)\*choose(2\*_r_, _r_)).

In this algorithm, a fair coin flip is generated as follows.  Let _m_ be an even integer that is 32 or greater (in general, the greater _m_ is, the more efficient the overall algorithm is in terms of coin flips).

1. Use extractor 1 to extract outputs from floor(_n_/_m_)*_m_ inputs, where _n_ is the number of input bits available to that extractor.  Do the same for the remaining extractors.
2. If extractor 2 has at least one unused output bit, take an output and stop.  Otherwise, repeat this step for the remaining extractors.
3. Flip the input coin at least _m_ times, append the coin results to extractor 1's inputs, and go to step 1.

Now consider the last paragraph of Proposition 2.5.  If the input coin were flipped in step 2, the probability of&mdash;

- giving out 1 in the algorithm's last step would be _P1_ = _&lambda;_<sup>_r_</sup>\*(1&minus;_&lambda;_)<sup>_r_</sup>\*_D_(_&lambda;_), and
- giving out either 0 or 1 in that step would be _P01_ = _&lambda;_<sup>_r_</sup>\*(1&minus;_&lambda;_)<sup>_r_</sup>\*_E_(_&lambda;_),

so that the algorithm would simulate _f_(_&lambda;_) = _P1_ / _P01_.  Observe that the _&lambda;_<sup>_r_</sup>\*(1&minus;_&lambda;_)<sup>_r_</sup> cancels out in the division.  Thus, we could replace flips of the input coin with fair coin flips and still simulate _f_(_&lambda;_); the _&lambda;_<sup>_r_</sup>\*(1&minus;_&lambda;_)<sup>_r_</sup> above would then be (1/2)<sup>2\*_r_</sup>.

While this algorithm is coin-flip-efficient, it is not believed to be an optimal factory, at least not without more work.  In particular, a bigger savings of input coin flips could occur if _f_(_&lambda;_) maps each value _a_ or greater and _b_ or less to a small range of values, so that the algorithm could, for example, generate a uniform random variate between 0 and 1 using fair coin flips and see whether that variate lies outside that range of values &mdash; and thus produce a sample from _f_(_&lambda;_) without flipping the input coin again.

<small>(&dagger;) For example, by translating the number to input bits via Pae's entropy-preserving binarization (Pae 2018\)[^35].  But correctness might depend on how this is done; after all, the number of coin flips per sample must equal or exceed the entropy bound for every _&lambda;_.</small>

### Pushdown Automata and Algebraic Functions

This section has mathematical proofs showing which kinds of algebraic functions (functions that can be a solution of a nonzero polynomial equation) can be simulated with a pushdown automaton (a state machine with a stack).

The following summarizes what can be established about these algebraic functions:

- sqrt(_&lambda;_) can be simulated.
- Every rational function with rational Bernstein coefficients that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself can be simulated.
- If _f_(_&lambda;_) can be simulated, so can any Bernstein-form polynomial in the variable _f_(_&lambda;_) with Bernstein coefficients that can be simulated.
- If _f_(_&lambda;_) and _g_(_&lambda;_) can be simulated, so can _f_(_&lambda;_)\*_g_(_&lambda;_), _f_(_g_(_&lambda;_)), and _g_(_f_(_&lambda;_)).
- If a full-domain pushdown automaton (defined later) can generate words of a given length with a given probability (a _probability distribution_ of word lengths), then the probability generating function for that distribution can be simulated, as well as for that distribution conditioned on a finite set or periodic infinite set of word lengths (for example, all odd word lengths only).
- If a stochastic context-free grammar (defined later) can generate a probability distribution of word lengths, and terminates with probability 1, then the probability generating function for that distribution can be simulated.
- Every quadratic irrational number between 0 and 1 can be simulated.

It is not yet known whether the following functions can be simulated:

- _&lambda;_<sup>1/_p_</sup> for prime numbers _p_ greater than 2. The answer may be no; Banderier and Drmota (2015)[^36] proved results that show, among other things, that $\lambda^{1/p}$, where $p$ is not a power of 2, is not a possible solution to $P(\lambda) = 0$, where $P(\lambda)$ is a polynomial whose "power" coefficients are nonnegative real numbers.
- min(_&lambda;_, 1&minus;_&lambda;_).

--------------------------------

The following definitions are used in this section:

1. A _pushdown automaton_ has a finite set of _states_ and a finite set of _stack symbols_, one of which is called EMPTY, and takes a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability. It starts at a given state and its stack starts with EMPTY.  On each iteration:
    - The automaton flips the coin.
    - Based on the coin flip (HEADS or TAILS), the current state, and the top stack symbol, it moves to a new state (or keeps it unchanged) and replaces the top stack symbol with zero, one or two symbols.  Thus, there are three kinds of _transition rules_:
         - (_state_, _flip_, _symbol_) &rarr; (_state2_, {_symbol2_}): move to _state2_, replace top stack symbol with same or different one.
         - (_state_, _flip_, _symbol_) &rarr; (_state2_, {_symbol2_, _new_}): move to _state2_, replace top stack symbol with _symbol2_, then _push_ a new symbol (_new_) onto the stack.
         - (_state_, _flip_, _symbol_) &rarr; (_state2_, {}): move to _state2_, _pop_ the top symbol from the stack.

    When the stack is empty, the machine stops, and returns either 0 or 1 depending on the state it ends up at.  (Because each left-hand side has no more than one possible transition, the automaton is _deterministic_.)

2. A _full-domain pushdown automaton_ means a pushdown automaton that terminates with probability 1 given a coin with probability of heads _&lambda;_, for every _&lambda;_ greater than 0 and less than 1.
3. **PDA** is the class of functions _f_(_&lambda;_) that satisfy 0<_f_(_&lambda;_)<1 whenever 0<_&lambda;_<1, and can be simulated by a full-domain pushdown automaton.  **PDA** also includes the constant functions 0 and 1.
4. **ALGRAT** is the class of functions that satisfy 0<_f_(_&lambda;_)<1 whenever 0<_&lambda;_<1, are continuous, and are algebraic over the rational numbers (they satisfy a nonzero polynomial system whose "power" coefficients are rational numbers; specifically, there is a nonzero polynomial _P_(_x_, _y_) in two variables and whose "power" coefficients are rational numbers, such that _P_(_x_, _f_(_x_)) = 0 for every _x_ in the domain of _f_). **ALGRAT** also includes the constant functions 0 and 1.
5. A _probability generating function_ has the form _p_<sub>0</sub>\*_&lambda;_<sup>0</sup> + _p_<sub>1</sub>\*_&lambda;_<sup>1</sup> + ..., where _p_<sub>_i_</sub> is the probability of getting _i_.

> **Notes:**
>
> 1. Mossel and Peres (2005\)[^34] defined pushdown automata to start with a nonempty stack of _arbitrary_ size, and to allow each rule to replace the top symbol with an _arbitrary_ number of symbols.  Both cases can be reduced to the definition in this section.
> 2. Pushdown automata, as defined here, are very similar to so-called _probabilistic right-linear indexed grammars_ (Icard 2020\)[^37] and can be translated to those grammars as well as to _probabilistic pushdown systems_ (Etessami and Yannakakis 2009\)[^37], as long as those grammars and systems use only transition probabilities that are rational numbers.

**Proposition 0** (Mossel and Peres 2005[^34], Theorem 1.2): _A full-domain pushdown automaton can simulate a function that maps (0, 1) to itself only if the function is in class **ALGRAT**._

It is not known whether **ALGRAT** and **PDA** are equal, but the following can be established about **PDA**:

**Lemma 1A:** _Let g(&lambda;) be a function in the class **PDA**, and suppose a pushdown automaton F has two rules of the form (`state`, HEADS, `stacksymbol`) &rarr; RHS1 and (`state`, TAILS, `stacksymbol`) &rarr; RHS2, where `state` and `stacksymbol` are a specific state/symbol pair among the left-hand sides of F's rules.  Then there is a pushdown automaton that transitions to RHS1 with probability g(&lambda;) and to RHS2 with probability 1&minus;g(&lambda;) instead._

_Proof:_ If RHS1 and RHS2 are the same, then the conclusion holds and nothing has to be done.  Thus assume RHS1 and RHS2 are different.

Let _G_ be the full-domain pushdown automaton for _g_. Assume that machines _F_ and _G_ stop when they pop EMPTY from the stack. If this is not the case, transform both machines by renaming the symbol EMPTY to EMPTY&prime;&prime;, adding a new symbol EMPTY&prime;&prime; and new starting state X0, and adding rules (X0, _flip_, EMPTY) &rarr; (_start_, {EMPTY&prime;&prime;}) and rule (_state_, _flip_, EMPTY) &rarr; (_state_, {}) for all states other than X0, where _start_ is the starting state of _F_ or _G_, as the case may be.

Now, rename each state of _G_ as necessary so that the sets of states of _F_ and of _G_ are disjoint (mutually exclusive).  Then, add to _F_ a new stack symbol EMPTY&prime; (or a name not found in the stack symbols of G, as the case may be).  Then, for the following two pairs of rules in _F_, namely&mdash;

(_state_, HEADS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_state2heads_, _stackheads_), and<br>
(_state_, TAILS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_state2tails_, _stacktails_),

add two new states _state_<sub>0</sub> and _state_<sub>1</sub> that correspond to _state_ and have names different from all other states, and replace that rule with the following rules:

(_state_, HEADS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_gstart_, {_stacksymbol_, EMPTY&prime;}),<br>
(_state_, TAILS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_gstart_, {_stacksymbol_, EMPTY&prime;}),<br>
(_state_<sub>0</sub>, HEADS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_state2heads_, _stackheads_),<br>
(_state_<sub>0</sub>, TAILS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_state2heads_, _stackheads_),<br>
(_state_<sub>1</sub>, HEADS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_state2tails_, _stacktails_), and<br>
(_state_<sub>1</sub>, TAILS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (_state2tails_, _stacktails_),<br>

where _gstart_ is the starting state for _G_, and copy the rules of the automaton for _G_ onto _F_, but with the following modifications:

- Replace the symbol EMPTY in _G_ with EMPTY&prime;.
- Replace each state in _G_ with a name distinct from all other states in _F_.
- Replace each rule in _G_ of the form (_state_, _flip_, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; (_state2_, {}), where _state2_ is a final state of _G_ associated with output 1, with the rule (_state_, _flip_, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; ( _state_<sub>1</sub>, {}).
- Replace each rule in _G_ of the form (_state_, _flip_, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; (_state2_, {}), where _state2_ is a final state of _G_ associated with output 0, with the rule (_state_, _flip_, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; ( _state_<sub>0</sub>, {}).

Then, the final states of the new machine are the same as those for the original machine _F_. &#x25a1;

**Lemma 1B:**  _There are pushdown automata that simulate the probabilities 0 and 1._

_Proof:_ The probability 0 automaton has the rules (START, HEADS, EMPTY) &rarr; (START, {}) and (START, TAILS, EMPTY) &rarr; (START, {}), and its only state START is associated with output 0. The probability 1 automaton is the same, except START is associated with output 1.  Both automata obviously terminate with probability 1. &#x25a1;

Because of Lemma 1A, it's possible to label each left-hand side of a pushdown automaton's rules with not just HEADS or TAILS, but also a rational number or another function in **PDA**, as long as for each state/symbol pair, the probabilities for that pair sum to 1.  For example, rules like the following are now allowed:

(START, 1/2, EMPTY) &rarr; ..., (START, sqrt(_&lambda;_)/2, EMPTY) &rarr; ..., (START, (1 &minus; sqrt(_&lambda;_))/2, EMPTY) &rarr; ....

**Proposition 1A:** _If f(&lambda;) is in the class **PDA**, then so is every polynomial written as&mdash;_

$${n\choose 0}f(\lambda)^0 (1-f(\lambda))^{n-0} a[0] + {n\choose 1}f(\lambda)^1 (1-f(\lambda))^{n-1} a[1] + ... + {n\choose n}f(\lambda)^n (1-f(\lambda))^{n-n} a[n],$$

_where n is the polynomial's degree and a\[0], a\[1], ..., a\[n] are functions in the class **PDA**._

_Proof Sketch_: This corresponds to a two-stage pushdown automaton that follows the algorithm of Goyal and Sigman (2012)[^7]\: The first stage counts the number of "heads" shown when flipping the f(&lambda;) coin, and the second stage flips another coin that has success probability _a_\[_i_\], where _i_ is the number of "heads". The automaton's transitions take advantage of Lemma 1A.  &#x25a1;

**Proposition 1:** _If f(&lambda;) and g(&lambda;) are functions in the class **PDA**, then so is their product, namely f(&lambda;)\*g(&lambda;)._

_Proof:_ Special case of Proposition 1A with _n_=1, _f_(_&lambda;_)=_f_(_&lambda;_), _a_\[0]=0 (using Lemma 1B), and _a_\[1]=_g_(_&lambda;_).  &#x25a1;

**Corollary 1A:** _If f(&lambda;), g(&lambda;), and h(&lambda;) are functions in the class **PDA**, then so is f(&lambda;)\*g(&lambda;) + (1&minus;f(&lambda;))\*h(&lambda;)._

_Proof:_ Special case of Proposition 1A with _n_=1, _f_(_&lambda;_)=_f_(_&lambda;_), _a_\[0]=_h_(_&lambda;_), and _a_\[1]=_g_(_&lambda;_).  &#x25a1;

**Proposition 2:** _If f(&lambda;) and g(&lambda;) are functions in the class **PDA**, then so is their composition, namely f(g(&lambda;)) or (f&#x2218;g)(&lambda;)._

_Proof:_ Let _F_ be the full-domain pushdown automaton for _f_. For each state/symbol pair among the left-hand sides of _F_'s rules, apply Lemma 1A to the automaton _F_, using the function _g_.  Then the new machine _F_ terminates with probability 1 because the original _F_ and the original automaton for _g_ do for every _&lambda;_ greater than 0 and less than 1, and because the automaton for _g_ never outputs the same value with probability 0 or 1 for any _&lambda;_ greater than 0 or less than 1.  Moreover, _f_ is in class **PDA** by Theorem 1.2 of (Mossel and Peres 2005\)[^34] because the machine is a full-domain pushdown automaton.  &#x25a1;

**Proposition 3:** _Every rational function with rational Bernstein coefficients that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself is in class **PDA**._

_Proof:_ These functions can be simulated by a finite-state machine (Mossel and Peres 2005\)[^34].  This corresponds to a full-domain pushdown automaton that has no stack symbols other than EMPTY, never pushes symbols onto the stack, and pops the only symbol EMPTY from the stack whenever it transitions to a final state of the finite-state machine. &#x25a1;

> **Note:** An unbounded stack size is necessary for a pushdown automaton to simulate functions that a finite-state machine can't.  With a bounded stack size, there is a finite-state machine where each state not only holds the pushdown automaton's original state, but also encodes the contents of the stack (which is possible because the stack's size is bounded); each operation that would push, pop, or change the top symbol transitions to a state with the appropriate encoding of the stack instead.

**Proposition 4:** _If a full-domain pushdown automaton can generate words with the same letter such that the length of each word follows a probability distribution, then that distribution's probability generating function is in class **PDA**._

_Proof:_ Let _F_ be a full-domain pushdown automaton.  Add one state FAILURE, then augment _F_ with a special "letter-generating" operation as follows.  Add the following rule that pops all symbols from the stack:

(FAILURE, _flip_, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (FAILURE, {}),

and for each rule of the following form that transitions to a letter-generating operation (where S and T are arbitrary states):

(S, _flip_, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (T, _newstack_),

add another state S&prime; (with a name that differs from all other states) and replace that rule with the following rules:

(S, _flip_, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (S&prime;, {_stacksymbol_}),<br/>
(S&prime;, HEADS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (T, _newstack_), and<br/>
(S&prime;, TAILS, _stacksymbol_) &rarr; (FAILURE, {}).

Then if the stack is empty upon reaching the FAILURE state, the result is 0, and if the stack is empty upon reaching any other state, the result is 1.  By Dughmi et al. (2021)[^38], the machine now simulates the distribution's probability generating function.  Moreover, the function is in class **PDA** by Theorem 1.2 of Mossel and Peres (2005)[^34] because the machine is a full-domain pushdown automaton.  &#x25a1;

Define a _stochastic context-free grammar_ as follows.  The grammar consists of a finite set of _nonterminals_ and a finite set of _letters_, and rewrites one nonterminal (the starting nonterminal) into a word.  The grammar has three kinds of rules (in generalized Chomsky normal form (Etessami and Yannakakis 2009)[^39]):

- _X_ &rarr; _a_ (rewrite _X_ to the letter _a_).
- _X_ &rarr;<sub>_p_</sub> (_a_, _Y_) (with rational probability _p_, rewrite _X_ to the letter _a_ followed by the nonterminal _Y_).  For the same left-hand side, all the _p_ values must sum to 1.
- _X_ &rarr; (_Y_, _Z_) (rewrite _X_ to the nonterminals _Y_ and _Z_ in that order).

Instead of a letter (such as _a_), a rule can use _&epsilon;_ (the empty string). (The grammar is _context-free_ because the left-hand side has only a single nonterminal, so that no context from the word is needed to parse it.)

**Proposition 5:** _Every stochastic context-free grammar can be transformed into a pushdown automaton.  If the automaton is a full-domain pushdown automaton and the grammar has a one-letter alphabet, the automaton can generate words such that the length of each word follows the same distribution as the grammar, and that distribution's probability generating function is in class **PDA**._

_Proof Sketch:_ In the equivalent pushdown automaton:

- _X_ &rarr; _a_ becomes the two rules&mdash;<br>(START, HEADS, _X_) &rarr; (_letter_, {}), and<br>(START, TAILS, _X_) &rarr; (_letter_, {}).<br>Here, _letter_ is either START or a unique state in _F_ that "detours" to a letter-generating operation for _a_ and sets the state back to START when finished (see Proposition 4).  If _a_ is _&epsilon;_, _letter_ is START and no letter-generating operation is done.
- _X_ &rarr;<sub>_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub> (_a_<sub>_i_</sub>, _Y_<sub>_i_</sub>) (all rules with the same nonterminal _X_) are rewritten to enough rules to transition to a letter-generating operation for _a_<sub>_i_</sub>, and swap the top stack symbol with _Y_<sub>_i_</sub>, with probability _p_<sub>_i_</sub>, which is possible with just a finite-state machine (see Proposition 4) because all the probabilities are rational numbers (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^34].  If _a_<sub>_i_</sub> is _&epsilon;_, no letter-generating operation is done.
- _X_ &rarr; (_Y_, _Z_) becomes the two rules&mdash;<br>(START, HEADS, _X_) &rarr; (START, {_Z_, _Y_}), and<br>(START, TAILS, _X_) &rarr; (START, {_Z_, _Y_}).

Here, _X_ is the stack symbol EMPTY if _X_ is the grammar's starting nonterminal. Now, assuming the automaton is full-domain, the rest of the result follows easily.   For a single-letter alphabet, the grammar corresponds to a system of polynomial equations, one for each rule in the grammar, as follows:

- _X_ &rarr; _a_ becomes _X_ = 1 if _a_ is the empty string (_&epsilon;_), or _X_ =  _&lambda;_ otherwise.
- For each nonterminal _X_, all _n_ rules of the form _X_ &rarr;<sub>_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub> (_a_<sub>_i_</sub>, _Y_<sub>_i_</sub>) become the equation _X_ = _p_<sub>1</sub>\*_&lambda;_<sub>1</sub>\*_Y_<sub>1</sub> + _p_<sub>2</sub>\*_&lambda;_<sub>2</sub>\*_Y_<sub>2</sub> + ... + _p_<sub>_n_</sub>\*_&lambda;_<sub>_n_</sub>\*_Y_<sub>_n_</sub>, where _&lambda;_<sub>_i_</sub> is either 1 if _a_<sub>_i_</sub> is _&epsilon;_, or _&lambda;_ otherwise.
- _X_ &rarr; (_Y_, _Z_) becomes _X_ = _Y_\*_Z_.

Solving this system for the grammar's starting nonterminal, and applying Proposition 4, leads to the _probability generating function_ for the grammar's word distribution.  (See also Flajolet et al. 2010[^40], Icard 2020[^41].) &#x25a1;

> **Example:** The stochastic context-free grammar&mdash;<br>_X_ &rarr;<sub>1/2</sub> (_a_, _X1_),<br>_X1_ &rarr; (_X_, _X2_),<br>_X2_ &rarr; (_X_, _X_),<br>_X_ &rarr;<sub>1/2</sub> (_a_, _X3_),<br>_X3_ &rarr; _&epsilon;_,<br>which encodes ternary trees (Flajolet et al. 2010)[^40], corresponds to the equation _X_ = (1/2) \* _&lambda;_\*_X_\*_X_\*_X_ + (1/2)\*_&lambda;_\*1, and solving this equation for _X_ leads to the probability generating function for such trees, which is a complicated expression.
>
> **Notes:**
>
> 1. A stochastic context-free grammar in which all the probabilities are 1/2 is called a _binary stochastic grammar_ (Flajolet et al. 2010)[^40].  If every probability is a multiple of 1/_n_, then the grammar can be called an "_n_-ary stochastic grammar".  It is even possible for a nonterminal to have two rules of probability _&lambda;_ and (1&minus; _&lambda;_), which are used when the input coin returns 1 (HEADS) or 0 (TAILS), respectively.
>
> 2. If a pushdown automaton simulates the function _f_(_&lambda;_), then _f_ corresponds to a special system of equations, built as follows (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^34]; see also Esparza et al. (2004)[^42].  For each state of the automaton (call the state _en_), include the following equations in the system based on the automaton's transition rules:
>
>     - (_st_, _p_, _sy_) &rarr; (_s2_, {}) becomes either _&alpha;_<sub>_st_,_sy_,_en_</sub> = _p_ if _s2_ is _en_, or _&alpha;_<sub>_st_,_sy_,_en_</sub> = 0 otherwise.
>     - (_st_, _p_, _sy_) &rarr; (_s2_, {_sy1_}) becomes _&alpha;_<sub>_st_,_sy_,_en_</sub> = _p_ \* _&alpha;_<sub>_s2_,_sy1_,_en_</sub>.
>     - (_st_, _p_, _sy_) &rarr; (_s2_, {_sy1_, _sy2_}) becomes _&alpha;_<sub>_st_,_sy_,_en_</sub> = _p_\*_&alpha;_<sub>_s2_,_sy2_,_&sigma;[1]_</sub>\*_&alpha;_<sub>_&sigma;[1]_,_sy1_,_en_</sub> + ... + _p_\*_&alpha;_<sub>_s2_,_sy2_,_&sigma;[n]_</sub>\*_&alpha;_<sub>_&sigma;[n]_,_sy1_,_en_</sub>, where _&sigma;[i]_ is one of the machine's _n_ states.
>
>     (Here, _p_ is the probability of using the given transition rule; the special value HEADS becomes _&lambda;_, and the special value TAILS becomes 1&minus;_&lambda;_.)  Now, each time multiple equations have the same left-hand side, combine them into one equation with the same left-hand side, but with the sum of their right-hand sides.  Then, for every variable of the form _&alpha;_<sub>_a_,_b_,_c_</sub> not yet present in the system, include the equation _&alpha;_<sub>_a_,_b_,_c_</sub> = 0.  Then, for each final state _fs_ that returns 1, solve the system for the variable _&alpha;_<sub>START,EMPTY,_fs_</sub> (where START is the automaton's starting state) to get a solution (a function) that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself. (Each solve can produce multiple solutions, but only one of them will map that open interval to itself assuming every _p_ is either HEADS or TAILS.) Finally, add all the solutions to get _f_(_&lambda;_).
>
> 3. Assume there is a pushdown automaton (_F_) that follows Definition 1 except it uses a set of _N_ input letters (and not simply HEADS or TAILS), accepts an input word if the stack is empty, and rejects the word if the machine reaches a configuration without a transition rule.  Then a pushdown automaton in the full sense of Definition 1 (_G_) can be built.  In essence:
>     1. Add a new FAILURE state, which when reached, pops all symbols from the stack.
>     2. For each pair (_state_, _stacksymbol_) for _F_, add a set of rules that generate one of the input letters (each letter _i_ generated with probability _f_<sub> _i_</sub>(_&lambda;_), which must be a function in **PDA**), then use the generated letter to perform the transition stated in the corresponding rule for _F_.  If there is no such transition, transition to the FAILURE state instead.
>     3. When the stack is empty, output 0 if _G_ is in the FAILURE state, or 1 otherwise.
>
>     Then _G_ returns 1 with the same probability as _F_ accepts an input word with letters randomly generated as in the second step.  Also, one of the _N_ letters can be a so-called "end-of-string" symbol, so that a pushdown automaton can be built that accepts "empty strings"; an example is Elder et al. (2015)[^43].

**Proposition 6:** _If a full-domain pushdown automaton can generate a distribution of words with the same letter, there is a full-domain pushdown automaton that can generate a distribution of such words conditioned on&mdash;_

1. _a finite set of word lengths, or_
2. _a periodic infinite set of word lengths._

One example of a finite set of word lengths is {1, 3, 5, 6}, where only words of length 1, 3, 5, or 6 are allowed.  A _periodic infinite set_ is defined by a finite set of integers such as {1}, as well as an integer modulus such as 2, so that in this example, all integers congruent to 1 modulo 2 (that is, all odd integers) are allowed word lengths and belong to the set.

_Proof Sketch:_

1. As in Lemma 1A, assume that the automaton stops when it pops EMPTY from the stack.  Let _S_ be the finite set (for example, {1, 3, 5, 6}), and let _M_ be the maximum value in the finite set.  For each integer _i_ in \[0, _M_\], make a copy of the automaton and append the integer _i_ to the name of each of its states.  Combine the copies into a new automaton _F_, and let its start state be the start state for copy 0.  Now, whenever _F_ generates a letter, instead of transitioning to the next state after the letter-generating operation (see Proposition 4), transition to the corresponding state for the next copy (for example, if the operation would transition to copy 2's version of "XYZ", namely "2\_XYZ", transition to "3\_XYZ" instead), or if the last copy is reached, transition to the last copy's FAILURE state.  If _F_ would transition to a failure state corresponding to a copy not in _S_ (for example, "0\_FAILURE", "2\_FAILURE", "3\_FAILURE" in this example), first all symbols other than EMPTY are popped from the stack and then _F_ transitions to its start state (this is a so-called "rejection" operation).  Now, all the final states (except FAILURE states) for the copies corresponding to the values in _S_ (for example, copies 1, 3, 5, 6 in the example) are treated as returning 1, and all other states are treated as returning 0.

2. Follow (1), except as follows: (A) _M_ is equal to the integer modulus minus 1.  (B) For the last copy of the automaton, instead of transitioning to the next state after the letter-generating operation (see Proposition 4), transition to the corresponding state for copy 0 of the automaton.  &#x25a1;

**Proposition 7:** _Every constant function equal to a quadratic irrational number between 0 and 1 is in class **PDA**._

A _continued fraction_ is one way to write a real number.  For purposes of the following proof, every real number greater than 0 and less than 1 has the following _continued fraction expansion_: 0 + 1 / (_a_[1] + 1 / (_a_[2] + 1 / (_a_[3] + ... ))), where each _a_\[_i_\], a _partial denominator_, is an integer greater than 0.  A _quadratic irrational number_ is an irrational number that can be written as (_b_+sqrt(_c_))/_d_, where _b_, _c_, and _d_ are rational numbers.

_Proof:_  By Lagrange's continued fraction theorem, every quadratic irrational number has a continued fraction expansion that is eventually periodic; the expansion can be described using a finite number of partial denominators, the last "few" of which repeat forever.  The following example describes a periodic continued fraction expansion: \[0; 1, 2, (5, 4, 3)\], which is the same as \[0; 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, ...\].  In this example, the partial denominators are the numbers after the semicolon; the size of the period (`(5, 4, 3)`) is 3; and the size of the nonperiod (`1, 2`) is 2.

Given a periodic expansion, and with the aid of an algorithm for simulating [**continued fractions**](https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Continued_Fractions), a recursive Markov chain for the expansion (Etessami and Yannakakis 2009)[^39] can be described as follows.  The chain's components are all built on the following template.  The template component has one entry E, one inner node N, one box, and two exits X0 and X1.  The box has one _call port_ as well as two _return ports_ B0 and B1.

- From E: Go to N with probability _x_, or to the box's call port with probability 1 &minus; _x_.
- From N: Go to X1 with probability _y_, or to X0 with probability 1 &minus; _y_.
- From B0: Go to E with probability 1.
- From B1: Go to X0 with probability 1.

Let _p_ be the period size, and let _n_ be the nonperiod size.  Now the recursive Markov chain to be built has _n_+_p_ components:

- For each _i_ in \[1, _n_+1\], there is a component labeled _i_.  It is the same as the template component, except _x_ = _a_\[_i_\]/(1 + _a_\[_i_\]), and _y_ = 1/_a_\[_i_\].  The component's single box goes to the component labeled _i_+1, _except_ that for component _n_+_p_, the component's single box goes to the component labeled _n_+1.

According to Etessami and Yannakakis (2009)[^39], the recursive Markov chain can be translated to a pushdown automaton of the kind used in this section. Now all that's left is to argue that the recursive Markov chain terminates with probability 1.  For every component in the chain, it goes from its entry to its box with probability 1/2 or less (because each partial numerator must be 1 or greater).  Thus, the component recurses with no greater probability than not, and there are otherwise no probability-1 loops in each component, so the overall chain terminates with probability 1. &#x25a1;

**Lemma 1:** _The square root function sqrt(&lambda;) is in class **PDA**._

_Proof:_ See Mossel and Peres (2005)[^34]. &#x25a1;

**Corollary 1:** _The function f(&lambda;) = &lambda;<sup>m/(2<sup>n</sup>)</sup>, where n &ge; 1 is an integer and where m &ge; 1 is an integer, is in class **PDA**._

_Proof:_ Start with the case _m_=1.  If _n_ is 1, write _f_ as sqrt(_&lambda;_); if _n_ is 2, write _f_ as (sqrt&#x2218;sqrt)(_&lambda;_); and for general _n_, write _f_ as (sqrt&#x2218;sqrt&#x2218;...&#x2218;sqrt)(_&lambda;_), with _n_ instances of sqrt.  Because this is a composition and sqrt can be simulated by a full-domain pushdown automaton, so can _f_.

For general _m_ and _n_, write _f_ as ((sqrt&#x2218;sqrt&#x2218;...&#x2218;sqrt)(_&lambda;_))<sup>_m_</sup>, with _n_ instances of sqrt.  This involves doing _m_ multiplications of sqrt&#x2218;sqrt&#x2218;...&#x2218;sqrt, and because this is an integer power of a function that can be simulated by a full-domain pushdown automaton, so can _f_.

Moreover, _f_ is in class **PDA** by Theorem 1.2 of (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^34] because the machine is a full-domain pushdown automaton. &#x25a1;

#### Finite-State and Pushdown Generators

Another interesting class of machines (called _pushdown generators_ here) are similar to pushdown automata (see above), with the following exceptions:

1. Each transition rule can also, optionally, give out a base-_N_ digit in its right-hand side.  An example is: (_state_, _flip_, _sy_) &rarr; (_digit_, _state2_, {_sy2_}).
2. The machine must output infinitely many digits if allowed to run forever.
3. Rules that would pop the last symbol from the stack are not allowed.

The "output" of the machine is now a real number _X_ in the form of the base-_N_ digit expansion `0.dddddd...`, where `dddddd...` are the digits produced by the machine from left to right.  In the rest of this section:

- `CDF(z)` is the cumulative distribution function of _X_, or the probability that _X_ is _z_ or less.
- `PDF(z)` is the probability density function of _X_, or the derivative of `CDF(z)`, or the relative probability of choosing a number "close" to _z_ at random.

A _finite-state generator_ (Knuth and Yao 1976)[^33] is the special case where the probability of heads is 1/2, each digit is either 0 or 1, rules can't push stack symbols, and only one stack symbol is used.  Then if `PDF(z)` has infinitely many derivatives on the open interval (0, 1), it must be a polynomial with rational Bernstein coefficients and satisfy `PDF(z) > 0` whenever 0 &le; `z` &le; 1 is irrational (Vatan 2001)[^44], (Kindler and Romik 2004)[^45], and it can be shown that the expected value (mean or "long-run average") of _X_ must be a rational number. [^46]

**Proposition 8.** _Suppose a finite-state generator can generate a probability distribution that takes on finitely many values.  Then:_

1. _Each value occurs with a rational probability._
2. _Each value is either rational or transcendental._

A real number is _transcendental_ if it can't be a root of a nonzero polynomial with integer "power" coefficients.  Thus, part 2 means, for example, that irrational, nontranscendental numbers such as 1/sqrt(2) and the golden ratio minus 1 can't be generated exactly.

Proving this proposition involves the following lemma, which shows that a finite-state generator is related to a machine with a one-way read-only input and a one-way write-only output:

**Lemma 2.** _A finite-state generator can fit the model of a one-way transducer-like k-machine (as defined in Adamczewski et al. (2020\)[^47] section 5.3), for some k equal to 2 or greater._

_Proof Sketch:_ There are two cases.

Case 1: If every transition rule of the generator gives out a digit, then _k_ is the number of unique inputs among the generator's transition rules (usually, there are two unique inputs, namely HEADS and TAILS), and the model of a finite-state generator is modified as follows:

1. A _configuration_ of the finite-state generator consists of its current state together with either the last coin flip result or, if the coin wasn't flipped yet, the empty string.
2. The _output function_ takes a configuration described earlier and returns a digit.  If the coin wasn't flipped yet, the function returns an arbitrary digit (which is not used in proposition 4.6 of the Adamczewski paper).

Case 2: If at least one transition rule does not give out a digit, then the finite-state generator can be transformed to a machine where HEADS/TAILS is replaced with 50% probabilities, then transformed to an equivalent machine whose rules always output one or more digits, as claimed in Lemma 5.2 of Vatan (2001)[^44].  In case the resulting generator has rules that output more than one digit, additional states and rules can be added so that the generator's rules output only one digit as desired.  Now at this point the generator's probabilities will be rational numbers. Now transform the generator from probabilities to inputs of size _k_, where _k_ is the product of those probabilities, by adding additional rules as desired.  &#x25a1;

_Proof of Proposition 8:_ Let _n_ be an integer greater than 0. Take a finite-state generator that starts at state START and branches to one of _n_ finite-state generators (subgenerators) with some probability, which must be rational because the overall generator is a finite-state machine (Icard 2020, Proposition 13)[^37].  The branching process outputs no digit, and part 3 of the proposition follows from Corollary 9 of Icard (2020)[^37].  The _n_ subgenerators are special; each of them generates the binary expansion of a single real number in the closed unit interval with probability 1.

To prove part 2 of the proposition, translate an arbitrary finite-state generator to a machine described in Lemma 2.  Once that is done, all that must be shown is that there are two different nonempty sequences of coin flips that end up at the same configuration. This is easy using the pigeonhole principle, since the finite-state generator has a finite number of configurations. Thus, by propositions 5.11, 4.6, and AB of Adamczewski et al. (2020)[^47], the generator can generate a real number's binary expansion only if that number is rational or transcendental (see also Cobham (1968)[^48]; Adamczewski and Bugeaud (2007)[^49]).  &#x25a1;

**Proposition 9.** _If the distribution function generated by a finite-state generator is continuous and algebraic on the open interval (0, 1), then that function is a piecewise polynomial function on that interval._

The proof follows from combining Kindler and Romik (2004, Theorem 2)[^45] and Knuth and Yao (1976)[^33] with Richman (2012)[^50], who proved that a continuous algebraic function on an open interval is piecewise analytic, so that each piece is analytic at every point except possibly at the endpoints.
