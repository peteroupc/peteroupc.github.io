## Examples of High-Quality PRNGs

Besides cryptographic random number generators (RNGs), the following are examples of [**high-quality pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs)**](https://peteroupc.github.io/random.html#High_Quality_RNGs_Requirements).  The "Fails PractRand Starting At" column in this and other tables in this page means the number of bytes (rounded up to the nearest power of two) at which PractRand detects a failure in the PRNG.  (Note that high-quality PRNGs, as I define them, are not necessarily appropriate for information security.)

### PRNGs with Stream Support

Some PRNGs support multiple "streams" that behave like independent uniform random bit sequences.  The test for independence involves interleaving two "streams"' outputs and sending the interleaved outputs to the PractRand tests.

The following lists high-quality PRNGs that support streams and their PractRand results for different strategies of forming pseudorandom number "streams".

<a id=Counter_Based_PRNGs></a>
### Counter-Based PRNGs

Constructions for counter-based PRNGs (using the definition from (Salmon et al. 2011, section 2\)[^7] include:

1. A PRNG that outputs hash codes of a counter and the seed.
2. A PRNG that uses a block cipher with the seed as a key to output encrypted counters.

More specifically, let C and S each be 64 or greater and divisible by 8.  Then:

1. A C-bit counter is set to 0 and an S-bit seed is chosen.  In each iteration, the PRNG outputs `H(seed || 0x5F || counter)` (where `H` is a hash function, `||` means concatenation, `0x5F` is the 8-bit block 0x5F, and `seed` and `counter` are little-endian encodings of the seed or counter, respectively), and adds 1 to the counter by wraparound addition.  Or...
2. A C-bit counter is set to 0 and an S-bit seed is chosen.  In each iteration, the PRNG outputs a block generated by a C-bit block cipher where the key is a little-endian encoding of the seed, and where the cleartext is a little-endian encoding of the counter, and adds 1 to the counter by wraparound addition.

The following lists hash functions and block ciphers that form high-quality counter-based PRNGs.  It's possible that reduced-round versions of these and other functions will also produce high-quality counter-based PRNGs.

### PRNGs Not Preferred

Although the following are technically high-quality PRNGs, they are not preferred:

| PRNG | Notes |
 ----------| --- |
| C++'s [**`std::ranlux48` engine**](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/ranlux48/) | Usually takes about 192 8-bit bytes of memory. Admits up to 2^577 - 2 seeds; seed's bits cannot be all zeros or all ones (L&uuml;scher 1994\)[^8].  The maximum cycle length for `ranlux48`'s underlying generator is very close to 2^576.  |
| A high-quality PRNG that is an LCG with non-prime modulus (or a PRNG based on one, such as PCG) | If the modulus is a power of 2, this PRNG can produce highly correlated pseudorandom number sequences from seeds that differ only in their high bits (see S. Vigna, "[**The wrap-up on PCG generators**](http://pcg.di.unimi.it/pcg.php)") and lowest bits have short cycles. (What PCG calls "streams" does not produce independent sequences.) |

### Implementation Notes: Splittable PRNGs

Here are implementation notes on splittable PRNGs.  The [**pseudocode conventions**](https://peteroupc.github.io/pseudocode.html) apply to this section.  In addition, the following notation is used:

- The `||` symbol means concatenation.
- `TOBYTES(x, n)` converts an integer to a sequence of `n` 8-bit bytes, in "little-endian" encoding: the first byte is the 8 least significant bits, the second byte is the next 8 bits, and so on. No more than `n` times 8 bits are encoded, and unused bytes become zeros.
- `BLOCKLEN` is the hash function's block size in bits.  For noncryptographic hash functions, this can be the function's output size in bits instead. `BLOCKLEN` is rounded up to the closest multiple of 8.
- `TOBLOCK(x)` is the same as `TOBYTES(x, BLOCKLEN / 8)`.

The splittable PRNG designs described here use _keyed hash functions_, which hash a message with a given key and output a hash code.  An unkeyed hash function can become a keyed hash function by hashing the following data: `key || TOBYTES(0x5F, 1) || message`.

The Claessen&ndash;Pa&#x142;ka splittable PRNG (Claessen and Pa&#x142;ka 2013\)[^14] can be described as follows:

- A PRNG state has two components: a seed and a path (a vector of bits).  A new state's seed is `TOBLOCK(seed)` and its path is an empty bit vector.
- `split` creates two new states from the old one; the first (or second) is a copy of the old state, except a 0 (or 1, respectively) is appended to the path.  If a new state's path reaches `BLOCKLEN` bits this way, the state's seed is set to the result of hashing `BitsToBytes(path)` with the seed as the key, and the state's path is set to an empty bit vector.
- `generate` creates a random number by hashing `BitsToBytes(path)` with the seed as the key.

(The Claessen paper, section 5, also shows how a sequence of numbers can be generated from a state, essentially by hashing the path with the seed as the key, and in turn hashing a counter with that hash code as the key, but uses a rather complicated encoding to achieve this.)

The following helper method, in pseudocode, is used in the description above:

    METHOD BitsToBytes(bits)
       // Unfortunately, the Claessen paper sec. 3.3 pads
       // blocks with zeros, creating a risk that different paths
       // encode to the same byte sequence (for example, <1100> vs.
       // <11000> or <0011> vs. <00011>). Even without this padding,
       // this risk exists unless the underlying hash function hashes
       // bit sequences (not just byte sequences), which is rare.
       // Therefore, encode the bits to a sequence of bytes
       // rather than using the encoding given in sec. 3.3.
       v = []
       for i in 0...size(bits): v = v || TOBYTES(bits[i], 1)
       return v
    END METHOD

The splittable PRNG described in "[**JAX PRNG Design**](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/master/design_notes/prng.md)" can be described as follows:

- A PRNG state is generated from a seed with `TOBLOCK(seed)`.
- `split` creates two new states from the old one; the first (or second) is a hash of `TOBLOCK(0)` (or `TOBLOCK(1)`, respectively) with the old state as the key.
- `generate` creates one or more random numbers by hashing `TOBLOCK(n)` with the state as the key, where `n` starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each new random number.
