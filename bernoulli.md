## Introduction

This page catalogs algorithms to turn coins biased one way into coins biased another way, also known as _Bernoulli factories_.  Many of them were suggested in (Flajolet et al., 2010)<sup>[**(1)**](#Note1)</sup>, but without step-by-step instructions in many cases.  This page provides these instructions to help programmers implement the Bernoulli factories they describe.

## About Bernoulli Factories

A _Bernoulli factory_ (Keane and O'Brien 1994)<sup>[**(2)**](#Note2)</sup> is an algorithm that takes an input coin (a method that returns 1, or heads, with an unknown probability, or 0, or tails, otherwise) and returns 0 or 1 with a probability that depends on the input coin's probability of heads.  For example, a Bernoulli factory algorithm can take a coin that returns heads with probability &lambda; and produce a coin that returns heads with probability exp(&minus;&lambda;).

A _factory function_ is a function that relates the old probability to the new one.  Its domain is [0, 1] and returns a probability in [0, 1].  There are certain requirements for factory functions.  As shown by Keane and O'Brien (1994)<sup>[**(2)**](#Note2)</sup>, a function _f_ can serve as a factory function if and only if _f_, in the interval \[0, 1\]&mdash;

    - is continuous everywhere, and
    - either returns a constant value in \[0, 1\] everywhere, or returns a value in \[0, 1\] at each of the points 0 and 1 and a value in (0, 1) at each other point.

As one example, the function _f_ = 2*p cannot serve as a factory function, since its graph touches 1 somewhere in the open interval (0, 1).

The next section will show algorithms for a number of factory functions, allowing different kinds of probabilities to be simulated from input coins.

## Algorithms

In the following algorithms:

- &lambda; is the unknown probability of heads of the input coin.
- The **SampleGeometricBag** and **URandLess** algorithms are described in my article on [**partially-sampled uniform random numbers**](https://peteroupc.github.io/exporand.html).
- The `ZeroOrOne` method should be implemented as shown in my article on [**random sampling methods**](https://peteroupc.github.io/randomfunc.html#Boolean_True_False_Conditions).
- The instruction to "generate a uniform random number" can be implemented by creating an empty [**partially-sampled uniform random number**](https://peteroupc.github.io/exporand.html) (most accurate) or by generating `RNDEXCRANGE(0, 1)` or `RNDINT(1000)` (less accurate).
- Where an algorithm says "if _a_ is less than _b_", where _a_ and _b_ are uniform random numbers, it means to run the **URandLess** algorithm on the two partially-sampled numbers, or do a less-than operation on _a_ and _b_, as appropriate.
- For best results, the algorithms should be implemented using exact rational arithmetic.

**Algorithms for exp(&minus;&lambda;)**.

The algorithm in (Flajolet et al., 2010)<sup>[**(1)**](#Note1)</sup>calls for generating a Poisson(&lambda;) random number and returning 1 if that number is 0, or 0 otherwise.  The Poisson generator in turn involves generating a geometric(&lambda;) random number _G_<sup>[**(3)**](#Note3)</sup>, then _G_ uniform random numbers, then returning 1 if all _G_ uniform numbers are sorted, or 0 otherwise.  The algorithm follows.

1. Flip the input coin until the coin returns 0.  Then set _G_ to the number of times the coin returns 1 this way.
2. If _G_ is 0, return 1.
3. Generate a uniform random number _w_, and set _i_ to 1.
4. While _i_ is less than _G_:
    1. Generate a uniform random number _U_.
    2. If _w_ is less than _U_, break out of this loop and go to step 1.
    3. Add 1 to _i_, and set _w_ to _U_.
5. Return 0.  (_G_ is now a Poisson(&lambda;) random number, but is other than 0.)

This algorithm, however, runs very slowly as &lambda; approaches 1.  Here is an alternative version of the algorithm above, which doesn't generate a geometric random number at the outset.

1. Set _k_ and _w_ each to 0.
2. Flip the input coin.  If the coin returns 0 and _k_ is 0, return 1.  Otherwise, if the coin returns 0, return 0.
3. Generate a uniform random number _U_.
4. If _k_ > 0 and _w_ is less than _U_, go to step 1.
5. Set _w_ to _U_, add 1 to _k_, and go to step 2.

In turn, this algorithm converges very slowly as &lambda; approaches 0.  Thus:

- If &lambda; is known to be less than 1/2, use the first algorithm.
- If &lambda; is known to be greater than 1/2, use the second algorithm.

A third algorithm is uniformly fast everywhere in (0, 1).   It uses the reverse-time martingale approach for alternating series in (Łatuszyński et al. 2009/2011)<sup>[**(4)**](#Note4)</sup> and makes use of the fact that exp(&minus;&lambda;) can be rewritten as&mdash;

    1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24 - ...,

which is an alternating series whose coefficients are 1, 1, 1/2!, 1/3!, 1/4!, ..., which satisfy the requirements for this approach because the coefficients are nonincreasing and all 1 or less.  However, the algorithm requires a bit more arithmetic, notably rational division.

First, the general algorithm for the reverse-time martingale approach (called the **general martingale algorithm** follows:

1. Let _c[0]_, _c[1]_, etc. be the first, second, etc. coefficients of the alternating series.  Set _u_ to _c[0]_, set _w_ to 1, set _l_ to 0, and set _n_ to 1.
2. Create an empty uniform PSRN.
3. If _w_ is not 0, flip the input coin and multiply _w_ by the result of the flip.
4. If _n_ is even, set _u_ to _l_ + _w_ * _c[n]_.  Otherwise, set _l_ to _u_ + _w_ * _c[n]_.
5. If the PSRN turns out to be less than _l_, return 1.
6. If the PSRN turns out to be greater than _u_, return 0.
7. Add 1 to _n_ and go to step 3.

For **exp(&minus;&lambda;)**, modify that algorithm as follows for more efficiency:

- Rather than multiplying by _c[n]_ in step 4, divide _w_ by _n_ in step 3 (after multiplying by the result of the flip).  This is a more efficient way to take account of the factorial in the second and later coefficients.

**Algorithm for exp(&lambda;)*(1&minus;&lambda;)**  (Flajolet et al., 2010)<sup>[**(1)**](#Note1)</sup>:

1. Set _k_ and _w_ each to 0.
2. Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 1.
3. Generate a uniform random number _U_.
4. If _k_ > 0 and _w_ is less than _U_, return 0.
5. Set _w_ to _U_, add 1 to _k_, and go to step 2.

**Algorithm for log(1+&lambda;)**  (Flajolet et al., 2010)<sup>[**(1)**](#Note1)</sup>:

1. Create an empty uniform partially-sampled random number (PSRN).
2. Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, flip the coin again and return the result.
3. Call the **SampleGeometricBag** algorithm with the PSRN.  If it returns 0, flip the input coin and return the result.
4. Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.
5. Call the **SampleGeometricBag** algorithm with the PSRN.  If it returns 0, return 0.
6. Go to step 2.

Alternatively, invert the result of the algorithm for 1 &minus; log(1+&lambda;) below (make it 1 if it's 0 and vice versa).

**Algorithm for 1 &minus; log(1+&lambda;).**  This algorithm uses the reverse-time martingale approach in (Łatuszyński et al. 2009/2011)<sup>[**(4)**](#Note4)</sup>.  Here, the alternating series is `1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/3 + ...`, whose coefficients are 1, 1, 1/2, 1/3, ....  Follow the general martingale algorithm.

Alternatively, invert the result of the algorithm for log(1+&lambda;) (make it 1 if it's 0 and vice versa).

**Algorithms for 1/(1+&lambda;).**

One algorithm is the general martingale algorithm, since when &lambda; is in [0, 1], this function is an alternating series of the form `1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ...`, whose coefficients are 1, 1, 1, 1, ....  However, this algorithm converges slowly when &lambda; is very close to 1.

A second algorithm is a special case of the two-coin Bernoulli factory of (Gonçalves et al., 2017)<sup>[**(5)**](#Note5)</sup> and is uniformly fast:

1. With probability 1/2, return 1. (For example, generate an unbiased random bit and return 1 if that bit is 1.)
2. Flip the input coin.  If it returns 1, return 0.  Otherwise, go to step 1.

**Algorithm for _c_ * &lambda; * &beta; / (&beta; (_c_ * &lambda; + _d_ * &mu;) &minus; (&beta; &minus; 1) * (_c_ + _d_)).**

This is the general two-coin algorithm of (Gonçalves et al., 2017)<sup>[**(6)**](#Note6)</sup> and (Vats et al. 2020)<sup>[**(7)**](#Note7)</sup>.  It takes two input coins that each output heads (1) with probability &lambda; or &mu;, respectively.  It also takes a parameter &beta;, which is a so-called "portkey" or early rejection parameter (when &beta; = 1, the formula simplifies to _c_ * &lambda; / (_c_ * &lambda; + _d_ * &mu;)).

1. If &beta; is not 1, return 0 with probability 1 &minus; &beta;. (For example, call `ZeroOrOne` with &beta;'s numerator and denominator and return 0 if that call returns 0.)
2. With probability _c_ / (_c_ + _d_), flip the &lambda; input coin.  Otherwise, flip the &mu; input coin.  If the &lambda; input coin returns 1, return 1.  If the &mu; input coin returns 1, return 0.
3. Go to step 1.
