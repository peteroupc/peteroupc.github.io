<h1>PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal</h1>

<h2>PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal</h2>

<pre>public sealed class EDecimal :
    System.IComparable,
    System.IEquatable
</pre>

<p>Represents an arbitrary-precision decimal floating-point number. (The &quot;E&quot; stands for &quot;extended&quot;, meaning that instances of this class can be values other than numbers proper, such as infinity and not-a-number.) <b>About decimal arithmetic</b></p>

<p>Decimal (base-10) arithmetic, such as that provided by this class, is appropriate for calculations involving such real-world data as prices and other sums of money, tax rates, and measurements. These calculations often involve multiplying or dividing one decimal with another decimal, or performing other operations on decimal numbers. Many of these calculations also rely on rounding behavior in which the result after rounding is an arbitrary-precision decimal number (for example, multiplying a price by a premium rate, then rounding, should result in a decimal amount of money).</p>

<p>On the other hand, most implementations of  <code>float</code>  and  <code>double</code>  , including in C# and Java, store numbers in a binary (base-2) floating-point format and use binary floating-point arithmetic. Many decimal numbers can&#39;t be represented exactly in binary floating-point format (regardless of its length). Applying binary arithmetic to numbers intended to be decimals can sometimes lead to unintuitive results, as is shown in the description for the FromDouble() method of this class.</p>

<p><b>About EDecimal instances</b></p>

<p>Each instance of this class consists of an integer significand and an integer exponent, both arbitrary-precision. The value of the number equals significand * 10^exponent.</p>

<p>The significand is the value of the digits that make up a number, ignoring the decimal point and exponent. For example, in the number 2356.78, the significand is 235678. The exponent is where the &quot;floating&quot; decimal point of the number is located. A positive exponent means &quot;move it to the right&quot;, and a negative exponent means &quot;move it to the left.&quot; In the example 2, 356.78, the exponent is -2, since it has 2 decimal places and the decimal point is &quot;moved to the left by 2.&quot; Therefore, in the arbitrary-precision decimal representation, this number would be stored as 235678 * 10^-2.</p>

<p>The significand and exponent format preserves trailing zeros in the number&#39;s value. This may give rise to multiple ways to store the same value. For example, 1.00 and 1 would be stored differently, even though they have the same value. In the first case, 100 * 10^-2 (100 with decimal point moved left by 2), and in the second case, 1 * 10^0 (1 with decimal point moved 0).</p>

<p>This class also supports values for negative zero, not-a-number (NaN) values, and infinity. <b>Negative zero</b> is generally used when a negative number is rounded to 0; it has the same mathematical value as positive zero. <b>Infinity</b> is generally used when a non-zero number is divided by zero, or when a very high or very low number can&#39;t be represented in a given exponent range. <b>Not-a-number</b> is generally used to signal errors.</p>

<p>This class implements the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification version 1.70 except part of chapter 6(  <code>http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html</code>  ).</p>

<p><b>Errors and Exceptions</b></p>

<p>Passing a signaling NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will signal the flag FlagInvalid and return a quiet NaN, even if another operand to that operation is a quiet NaN, unless the operation&#39;s documentation expressly states that another result happens when a signaling NaN is passed to that operation.</p>

<p>Passing a quiet NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will return a quiet NaN, unless the operation&#39;s documentation expressly states that another result happens when a quiet NaN is passed to that operation. Invalid operations will also return a quiet NaN, as stated in the individual methods.</p>

<p>Unless noted otherwise, passing a null arbitrary-precision decimal argument to any method here will throw an exception.</p>

<p>When an arithmetic operation signals the flag FlagInvalid, FlagOverflow, or FlagDivideByZero, it will not throw an exception too, unless the flag&#39;s trap is enabled in the arithmetic context (see EContext&#39;s Traps property).</p>

<p>If an operation requires creating an intermediate value that might be too big to fit in memory (or might require more than 2 gigabytes of memory to store -- due to the current use of a 32-bit integer internally as a length), the operation may signal an invalid-operation flag and return not-a-number (NaN). In certain rare cases, the CompareTo method may throw OutOfMemoryException (called OutOfMemoryError in Java) in the same circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Serialization</b></p>

<p>An arbitrary-precision decimal value can be serialized (converted to a stable format) in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By calling the toString() method, which will always return distinct strings for distinct arbitrary-precision decimal values.</p></li>
<li><p>By calling the UnsignedMantissa, Exponent, and IsNegative properties, and calling the IsInfinity, IsQuietNaN, and IsSignalingNaN methods. The return values combined will uniquely identify a particular arbitrary-precision decimal value.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Thread safety</b></p>

<p>Instances of this class are immutable, so they are inherently safe for use by multiple threads. Multiple instances of this object with the same properties are interchangeable, so they should not be compared using the &quot;==&quot; operator (which might only check if each side of the operator is the same instance).</p>

<p><b>Comparison considerations</b></p>

<p>This class&#39;s natural ordering (under the CompareTo method) is not consistent with the Equals method. This means that two values that compare as equal under the CompareTo method might not be equal under the Equals method. The CompareTo method compares the mathematical values of the two instances passed to it (and considers two different NaN values as equal), while two instances with the same mathematical value, but different exponents, will be considered unequal under the Equals method.</p>

<p><b>Security note</b></p>

<p>It is not recommended to implement security-sensitive algorithms using the methods in this class, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>EDecimal</code>  objects are immutable, so they can&#39;t be modified, and the memory they occupy is not guaranteed to be cleared in a timely fashion due to garbage collection. This is relevant for applications that use many-digit-long numbers as secret parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>The methods in this class (especially those that involve arithmetic) are not guaranteed to be &quot;constant-time&quot; (non-data-dependent) for all relevant inputs. Certain attacks that involve encrypted communications have exploited the timing and other aspects of such communications to derive keying material or cleartext indirectly.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Applications should instead use dedicated security libraries to handle big numbers in security-sensitive algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Reproducibility note</b></p>

<p>Some applications, such as simulations, care about results that are reproducible, bit for bit, across computers and across runs of the application. Bruce Dawson, in &quot;Floating-Point Determinism&quot; (  <code>https://randomascii.wordpress.com/</code>  <code>2013/07/16/floating-point-determinism/</code>  ), identified many reproducibility issues with floating-point numbers, and here is how they relate to the EDecimal and EFloat classes of this library:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Runtime floating-point settings: All the settings that change how EDecimal and EFloat behave are given as parameters to the appropriate methods, especially via EContext objects, which specify the precision, rounding, and exponent range of numbers, among other things. The EDecimal and EFloat classes avoid the use of &quot;native&quot; floating-point data types (except for methods that convert to or from  <code>float</code>  ,  <code>double</code>  , or  <code>System.Decimal</code>  ). Such &quot;native&quot; types are often subject to runtime settings that change how floating-point math behaves with them, and these settings are often not accessible to .NET or Java code.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-associativity and intermediate precisions: In general, EDecimal and EFloat use &quot;unlimited&quot; precision in their calculations unless specified otherwise by an EContext object. However, by limiting the precision of EDecimal, EFloat, and other floating-point numbers in this way, operations such as addition and multiplication on three or more numbers can be <i>non-associative</i> , meaning the result can change depending on the order in which those numbers are added or multiplied. This property means that if an algorithm does not ensure such numbers are added or multiplied in the same order every time, its results may not be reproducible across computers or across runs of the application. This non-associativity problem can happen, for example, if an application splits a calculation across several threads and combines their results in the end. The problems with an unspecified order of operations (in the same line of code) and intermediate precisions (problems present in C and C++, for example) don&#39;t exist with method calls to EDecimal and EFloat methods, especially since they require limited-precision support to be declared explicitly via EContext.</p></li>
<li><p>fmadd instruction: EDecimal and EFloat include a MultiplyAndAdd method with the same semantics as in the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification, which requires delivering correctly rounded results for this method.</p></li>
<li><p>Square root estimate: Not applicable since EDecimal and EFloat don&#39;t include any estimates to square root.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcendental functions: This includes logarithms, exponentials, and the Pi method. For these functions, results are not guaranteed to always be correctly rounded. When using transcendentals, an application that cares about reproducibility should choose one version of this library and stick to it; this at least has the advantage that the implementation will be the same across computers, unlike with &quot;native&quot; floating-point types where the choice of implementation is often not within the application&#39;s control.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversions: Conversions between EDecimal or EFloat and text strings have the same implementation across computers for the same version of this library (see also the advice for transcendentals above). But as for the ToDouble, ToSingle, FromDouble, and FromSingle methods, note that some implementations of Java and.NET may or may not support preserving the value of subnormal numbers (numbers with the lowest possible exponent, but are not zero) or the payloads held in a not-a-number (NaN) value of float or double; thus these methods should not be considered reproducible across computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiler differences: Not applicable where these classes don&#39;t use &quot;native&quot; floating-point types.</p></li>
<li><p>Uninitialized data; per-processor code: Not applicable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Forms of numbers</b></p>

<p>There are several other types of numbers that are mentioned in this class and elsewhere in this documentation. For reference, they are specified here.</p>

<p><b>Unsigned integer</b> : An integer that&#39;s always 0 or greater, with the following maximum values:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>8-bit unsigned integer, or <i>byte</i> : 255.</p></li>
<li><p>16-bit unsigned integer: 65535.</p></li>
<li><p>32-bit unsigned integer: (2 <sup>32</sup> -1).</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit unsigned integer: (2 <sup>64</sup> -1).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Signed integer</b> : An integer in <i>two&#39;s-complement form</i> , with the following ranges:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>8-bit signed integer: -128 to 127.</p></li>
<li><p>16-bit signed integer: -32768 to 32767.</p></li>
<li><p>32-bit signed integer: -2 <sup>31</sup> to (2 <sup>31</sup> - 1).</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit signed integer: -2 <sup>63</sup> to (2 <sup>63</sup> - 1).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Two&#39;s complement form</b> : In <i>two&#39;s-complement form</i> , nonnegative numbers have the highest (most significant) bit set to zero, and negative numbers have that bit (and all bits beyond) set to one, and a negative number is stored in such form by decreasing its absolute value by 1 and swapping the bits of the resulting number.</p>

<p><b>64-bit floating-point number</b> : A 64-bit binary floating-point number, in the form <i>significand</i> * 2 <sup><i>exponent</i></sup> . The significand is 53 bits long (Precision) and the exponent ranges from -1074 (EMin) to 971 (EMax). The number is stored in the following format (commonly called the IEEE 754 format):</p>

<pre>|C|BBB...BBB|AAAAAA...AAAAAA|
</pre>

<ul>
<li><p>A. Low 52 bits (Precision minus 1 bits): Lowest bits of the significand.</p></li>
<li><p>B. Next 11 bits: Exponent area:</p></li>
<li><p>If all bits are ones, the final stored value is infinity (positive or negative depending on the C bit) if all bits in area A are zeros, or not-a-number (NaN) otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>If all bits are zeros, the final stored value is a subnormal number, the exponent is EMin, and the highest bit of the significand is zero.</p></li>
<li><p>If any other number, the exponent is this value reduced by 1, then raised by EMin, and the highest bit of the significand is one.</p></li>
<li><p>C. Highest bit: If one, this is a negative number.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The elements described above are in the same order as the order of each bit of each element, that is, either most significant first or least significant first.</p>

<p><b>32-bit binary floating-point number</b> : A 32-bit binary number which is stored similarly to a <i>64-bit floating-point number</i> , except that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Precision is 24 bits.</p></li>
<li><p>EMin is -149.</p></li>
<li><p>EMax is 104.</p></li>
<li><p>A. The low 23 bits (Precision minus 1 bits) are the lowest bits of the significand.</p></li>
<li><p>B. The next 8 bits are the exponent area.</p></li>
<li><p>C. If the highest bit is one, this is a negative number.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>.NET Framework decimal</b> : A 128-bit decimal floating-point number, in the form <i>significand</i> * 10 <sup>- <i>scale</i></sup> , where the scale ranges from 0 to 28. The number is stored in the following format:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Low 96 bits are the significand, as a 96-bit unsigned integer (all 96-bit values are allowed, up to (2 <sup>96</sup> -1)).</p></li>
<li><p>Next 16 bits are unused.</p></li>
<li><p>Next 8 bits are the scale, stored as an 8-bit unsigned integer.</p></li>
<li><p>Next 7 bits are unused.</p></li>
<li><p>If the highest bit is one, it&#39;s a negative number.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The elements described above are in the same order as the order of each bit of each element, that is, either most significant first or least significant first.</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p>The number 0 if both objects have the same value (ignoring their signs), or -1 if this object is less than the other value (ignoring their signs), or 1 if this object is greater (ignoring their signs).

<h3>FromDouble</h3>

<pre>public static PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal FromDouble(

<p>Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a 64-bit binary floating-point number.

<p>Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a text string that represents a number.</p>

<p>The format of the string generally consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An optional plus sign (&quot;+&quot; , U+002B) or minus sign (&quot;-&quot;, U+002D) (if the minus sign, the value is negative.)</p></li>

<li><p>Optionally, &quot;E&quot;/&quot;e&quot; followed by an optional (positive exponent) or &quot;-&quot; (negative exponent) and followed by one or more digits specifying the exponent (these digits may begin with any number of zeros).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The string can also be &quot;-INF&quot;, &quot;-Infinity&quot;, &quot;Infinity&quot;, &quot;INF&quot;, quiet NaN (&quot;NaN&quot; /&quot;-NaN&quot;) followed by any number of digits (these digits may begin with any number of zeros), or signaling NaN (&quot;sNaN&quot; /&quot;-sNaN&quot;) followed by any number of digits (these digits may begin with any number of zeros), all where the letters can be any combination of basic upper-case and/or basic lower-case letters.</p>

<p>All characters mentioned above are the corresponding characters in the Basic Latin range. In particular, the digits must be the basic digits 0 to 9 (U+0030 to U+0039). The string is not allowed to contain white space characters, including spaces.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<p>Converts this value to its closest equivalent as a 64-bit floating-point number. The half-even rounding mode is used. If this value is a NaN, sets the high bit of the 64-bit floating point number&#39;s significand area for a quiet NaN, and clears it for a signaling NaN.

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<h3>Quantize</h3>

<pre>public PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal Quantize(
    int desiredExponentInt,
    PeterO.Numbers.EContext ctx);
</pre>

<p>Returns an arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value but a new exponent. Note that this is not always the same as rounding to a given number of decimal places, since it can fail if the difference between this value&#39;s exponent and the desired exponent is too big, depending on the maximum precision. If rounding to a number of decimal places is desired, it&#39;s better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.</p>

<p><b>Remark:</b> This method can be used to implement fixed-point decimal arithmetic, in which each decimal number has a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. The following code example returns a fixed-point number with up to 20 digits before and exactly 5 digits after the decimal point:</p>

<pre>/* After performing arithmetic operations, adjust the number to 5
            digits
            after the decimal point */ number = number.Quantize(-5, /* five digits
            after the decimal point */EContext.ForPrecision(25) /* 25-digit
            precision*/);
</pre>

<p>A fixed-point decimal arithmetic in which no digits come after the decimal point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an &quot;integer arithmetic&quot;.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><p><i>desiredExponentInt</i>: The desired exponent for the result. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number. Can also be positive, which eliminates lower-order places from the number. For example, -3 means round to the thousandth (10^-3, 0.0001), and 3 means round to the thousand (10^3, 1000). A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.</p></li>
<li><p><i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision and rounding of the result. If  <code>HasFlags</code>  of the context is true, will also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags are in addition to the pre-existing flags). Can be null, in which case the default rounding mode is HalfEven.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p>An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number (NaN) if this object is infinity, if the rounded result can&#39;t fit the given precision, or if the context defines an exponent range and the given exponent is outside that range.</p>

<li><p><i>rounding</i>: A rounding mode to use in case the result needs to be rounded to fit the given exponent.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Return Value:</b></p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b></p>

<ul>
