<p>Specifies how JSON numbers are converted to CBOR objects when decoding JSON (such as via  <code>FromJSONString</code>  or  <code>ReadJSON</code>  ). None of these conversion modes affects how CBOR objects are later encoded (such as via  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  ).</p>

<h3>Decimal128</h3>

<pre>public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Decimal128 = 4;
</pre>

<p>JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR as their closest-rounded approximation to an IEEE 854 decimal128 value, using the rules for the EDecimal form of that approximation as given in the  <code>CBORObject.FromObject(EDecimal)</code>  method. (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to zero, and numbers of extremely large absolute value may overflow to infinity.).</p>

<p><a id="Double"></a></p>

<h3>Double</h3>

<pre>public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Double = 1;
</pre>

<p>JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR as their closest-rounded approximation as 64-bit binary floating-point numbers (using the round-to-nearest/ties-to-even rounding mode). (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to positive or negative zero, and numbers of extremely large absolute value may overflow to infinity.). It&#39;s important to note that this mode affects only how JSON numbers are <i>decoded</i> to a CBOR object; it doesn&#39;t affect how  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  and other methods encode CBOR objects. Notably, by default,  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  encodes CBOR floating-point values to the CBOR format in their 16-bit (&quot;half-float&quot;), 32-bit (&quot;single-precision&quot;), or 64-bit (&quot;double-precision&quot;) encoding form depending on the value.</p>

<p><a id="Full"></a></p>

<h3>Full</h3>

<pre>public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode Full = 0;
</pre>

<p>JSON numbers are decoded to CBOR using the full precision given in the JSON text. The number will be converted to a CBOR object as follows: If the number&#39;s exponent is 0 (after shifting the decimal point to the end of the number without changing its value), use the rules given in the  <code>CBORObject.FromObject(EInteger)</code>  method; otherwise, use the rules given in the  <code>CBORObject.FromObject(EDecimal)</code>  method. An exception in version 4.x involves negative zeros; if the negative zero&#39;s exponent is 0, it&#39;s written as a CBOR floating-point number; otherwise the negative zero is written as an EDecimal.</p>

<p><a id="IntOrFloat"></a></p>

<h3>IntOrFloat</h3>

<pre>public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode IntOrFloat = 2;
</pre>

<p>A JSON number is decoded to CBOR objects either as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1) if the JSON number represents an integer at least -(2^53)+1 and less than 2^53, or as their closest-rounded approximation as 64-bit binary floating-point numbers (using the round-to-nearest/ties-to-even rounding mode) otherwise. For example, the JSON number 0.99999999999999999999999999999999999 is not an integer, so it&#39;s converted to its closest 64-bit binary floating-point approximation, namely 1.0. (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to positive or negative zero, and numbers of extremely large absolute value may overflow to infinity.). It&#39;s important to note that this mode affects only how JSON numbers are <i>decoded</i> to a CBOR object; it doesn&#39;t affect how  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  and other methods encode CBOR objects. Notably, by default,  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  encodes CBOR floating-point values to the CBOR format in their 16-bit (&quot;half-float&quot;), 32-bit (&quot;single-precision&quot;), or 64-bit (&quot;double-precision&quot;) encoding form depending on the value.</p>

<h3>IntOrFloatFromDouble</h3>

<pre>public static PeterO.Cbor.JSONOptions.ConversionMode IntOrFloatFromDouble = 3;
</pre>

<p>A JSON number is decoded to CBOR objects either as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1) if the number&#39;s closest-rounded approximation as a 64-bit binary floating-point number (using the round-to-nearest/ties-to-even rounding mode) represents an integer at least -(2^53)+1 and less than 2^53, or as that approximation otherwise. For example, the JSON number 0.99999999999999999999999999999999999 is the integer 1 when rounded to its closest 64-bit binary floating-point approximation (1.0), so it&#39;s converted to the CBOR integer 1 (major type 0). (In some cases, numbers extremely close to zero may underflow to zero, and numbers of extremely large absolute value may overflow to infinity.). It&#39;s important to note that this mode affects only how JSON numbers are <i>decoded</i> to a CBOR object; it doesn&#39;t affect how  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  and other methods encode CBOR objects. Notably, by default,  <code>EncodeToBytes</code>  encodes CBOR floating-point values to the CBOR format in their 16-bit (&quot;half-float&quot;), 32-bit (&quot;single-precision&quot;), or 64-bit (&quot;double-precision&quot;) encoding form depending on the value.</p>
