# Suggestions for Instructional Materials

These are suggestions to improve core and supplemental instructional materials, for all school subjects, used in U.S. schools from kindergarten to twelfth grade.

1. Instructional materials should be open educational resources (OER), available under an open license, such as CC-BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial) or a more permissive license.  For the instructional materials, there should be a GitHub or GitLab repository containing the source code of the materials.  This may make it easier for the general public to view, edit, give feedback on, and suggest changes to the instructional materials, for various reasons: to reduce cognitive load on students (without reducing rigor), to improve cultural responsiveness, to correct errors, to best take advantage of research on how people learn (such as retrieval practice and interleaving of topics), and for other reasons.
2. Instructional materials should consider incorporating mindfulness in each lesson.  As one example, the following article suggests a "mindfulness minute" at the start of each class period:

3. Instructional materials should incorporate practices that encourage retention of information in memory.  An example is no-stakes retrieval practice (quizzing) at the end of every lesson, or the brain/book/buddy protocol popularized by Blake Harvard.  See, for example, the link above as well as:

4. Instructional materials should adopt as many of [**Rosenshine's principles of instruction**](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/Rosenshine.pdf) as possible. Instructional materials should avoid "minimally guided instruction", such as discovery learning, because such instruction often goes against research on how people learn (e.g., cognitive load theory).  A paper by Rosenshine and colleagues called "Why Minimally Guided Instruction Does Not Work" gives details.
5. There is guidance for increasing rigor and quality of [**Hispanic American content**](https://unidosus.org/publications/analyzing-inclusion-of-latino-contributions-in-us-history-curricula-for-high-school/) and [**black American content**](https://hub.jhu.edu/2021/02/10/black-history-curricula-lacking-rigor-and-quality/) in U.S. History instructional materials.
6. There is guidance for the length of daily Social Studies and Science instruction up to fifth grade: [**45 minutes**](https://ccsso.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/Elementary%20SS%20Brief%2045%20Minute%20Version_0.pdf) and [**60 minutes**](https://www.nsta.org/nstas-official-positions/elementary-school-science), respectively.
7. In Literacy, instructional materials should be knowledge-based and follow the criteria given in the [**Knowledge Matters Campaign's review tool**](https://knowledgematterscampaign.org/review-tool/).  In other subjects, instructional materials should likewise be [**knowledge-rich**](https://teacherhead.com/2018/06/06/what-is-a-knowledge-rich-curriculum-principle-and-practice/).

These suggestions concern only instructional materials, so policies such as those that restrict cell phones in school or encourage the [**reduction of classroom decorations**](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/getting-the-principles-just-right-classroom-decoration/), while they may be helpful because they can reduce students' cognitive load, are outside the scope.
