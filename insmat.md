# Suggestions for Instructional Materials

These are suggestions to improve core and supplemental instructional materials, for all school subjects, used in U.S. schools from kindergarten to twelfth grade.

1. Instructional materials should be open educational resources (OER), available under an open license, such as CC-BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike) or a more permissive license.  For the instructional materials, there should be a GitHub or GitLab repository containing the source code of the materials.  This may make it easier for the general public to view, edit, give feedback on, and suggest changes to the instructional materials for various reasons, including the following:

    - To reduce cognitive load on students and teachers (without reducing rigor).
    - To improve historical accuracy and cultural responsiveness.
    - To correct errors.
    - To best take advantage of research on how people learn (such as retrieval practice and interleaving of topics).
    - To keep the materials up to date with scientific, technological, and historical scholarship.
    - To reduce preparation time for teachers.

2. Instructional materials should incorporate practices that encourage retention of information in memory.  An example is low- or no-stakes retrieval practice (quizzing) at the end of every lesson, or the brain/book/buddy protocol popularized by Blake Harvard.  See, for example, the following:

3. Instructional materials should adopt as many of [**Rosenshine's principles of instruction**](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/Rosenshine.pdf) as possible. Instructional materials should avoid "minimally guided instruction", such as discovery learning, because such instruction often goes against research on how people learn (e.g., cognitive load theory).  A paper by Kirschner and colleagues called "[**Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1)" (Educ. Psych. 41, 2006) gives details.
4. In Literacy, instructional materials should be knowledge-based and follow the criteria given in the [**Knowledge Matters Campaign's review tool**](https://knowledgematterscampaign.org/review-tool/).  In other subjects, instructional materials should likewise be [**knowledge-rich**](https://teacherhead.com/2018/06/06/what-is-a-knowledge-rich-curriculum-principle-and-practice/).
5. There is guidance for:

    - Increasing rigor and quality of [**Latino American content**](https://unidosus.org/publications/analyzing-inclusion-of-latino-contributions-in-us-history-curricula-for-high-school/) and [**black American content**](https://hub.jhu.edu/2021/02/10/black-history-curricula-lacking-rigor-and-quality/) in U.S. History instructional materials.
    - Improving [**cultural responsiveness**](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/2020-12/CRE%20Scorecard%20Revised%20Aug%202020.pdf) in Literacy instructional materials.
    - The length of daily Social Studies and Science instruction up to fifth grade: [**45 minutes**](https://ccsso.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/Elementary%20SS%20Brief%2045%20Minute%20Version_0.pdf) and [**60 minutes**](https://www.nsta.org/nstas-official-positions/elementary-school-science), respectively.
    - Structuring lessons in History and other aspects of Social Studies using the [**Four-Question Method**](https://4qmteaching.net/).
    - Structuring lessons in U.S. Civics using the questions in the civics portion of the naturalization test given by the U.S. government.

6. Instructional materials in Literacy should teach synonyms for new words to be learned and for other words and phrases prone to overuse.  In sixth grade and up, they should include copious lessons on grammatical analysis and knowledge of English syntax, as well as concrete guidance to help students avoid the following in their writing:

    - Overuse of certain words or phrases, both within and across writings [^1].
    - Imprecise word choices, especially choices of overused words.
    - Redundancy (which includes unnecessary words) not serving an expressive purpose.
    - Ambiguous language.

These suggestions concern only instructional materials, so policies such as those that [**restrict mobile phones in school**](https://www.educationnext.org/take-away-their-cellphones-rewire-schools-belonging-achievement/) or encourage the [**reduction of classroom decorations**](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/getting-the-principles-just-right-classroom-decoration/), while they may be helpful because they can reduce students' cognitive load, are outside the scope, and encouraging students' mindfulness is likewise outside the scope even though it's likely [**no better than other social-emotional learning initiatives**](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/does-mindfulness-help-a-blockbuster-new-study/). [^2]

Suggestion number 6, in particular, is intended to address observations that our language may be getting poorer by the year, in terms of everyday vocabulary and linguistic variety (see, e.g., Emilio Bernal's "Good usage prevents abusage").

[^1]: A list of some of the [**overused and discouraged words**](http://peteroupc.github.io/usage.html) is given elsewhere.  The works of Emilio Bernal Labrada, Theodore Bernstein, Mario Pei, Bill Bryson, and Richard Lederer, among others, provide guidance on good English usage.

[^2]: Additional suggestions to improve education, which instructional materials could choose to address, are as follows: (1) Encouraging caregivers to keep mobile phones and social media away from their children, especially if the caregivers themselves use social media for 1 hour or more daily. (2) A playlist of made-for-kids videos relating to topics in the Core Knowledge Foundation's _Core Knowledge Sequence_ (especially videos that invite viewers to answer questions on the topics), for each grade from kindergarten to eighth grade, intended for children to optionally watch at home outside of instruction. (3) The "Good Behavior Game" as a way to encourage students to follow classroom rules. (4) For Literacy, a free and open-source English grammar reference book designed for middle school and secondary students. (5) The recognition that Social Studies encompasses history, geography (natural and human), culture, civics, and economics and instruction in Social Studies should be knowledge-rich and lay an accent on the country and subnational region where the instruction takes place.
