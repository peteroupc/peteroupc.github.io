<h1 id="overused-and-discouraged-words-and-phrases">Overused and Discouraged Words and Phrases</h1>

<p>To improve English usage, reduce monotony, and enrich English vocabulary in writing and speech, I have compiled these two lists on what not to say and what to say better.  Many items in these tables were inspired by Emilio Bernal Labrada, “Good usage prevents abusage”, 2018.</p>

<p>The lists could also be useful as a handout to Literacy students from ninth grade and up, or to suggest alternatives to overused and discouraged words for younger students.  For my other suggestions on Literacy instruction, see “<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/insmat.html"><strong>Suggestions for Instructional Materials</strong></a>”.</p>

<p>This is an open-source document; see its <a href="https://github.com/peteroupc/peteroupc.github.io/raw/master/usage.md"><strong>source code</strong></a>.

<p>Another technique to try is to rewrite a text to avoid overused words as much as possible.</p>

<p><a id="Discouraged_Words"></a></p>

<h2 id="discouraged-words">Discouraged Words</h2>

<p>Emilio Bernal, in “Good usage prevents abusage”, wrote of his concerns about, among other things, the overuse of <em>people</em>, <em>persons</em>, <em>members</em>, <em>day</em>, and <em>happen</em>, as well as the unnecessary repetition of words (for example, <em>He is someone who is reliable</em>; <em>She wants what she wants</em>; <em>It’ll happen when it’ll happen</em>).  His work formed the basis of many of the suggestions in the following table.</p>

<p>Even here, it is worth trying to rewrite a text to avoid discouraged words to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p>** Use “whether or not B” or “whether B or not” only to mean ‘both if B and if not’.</p>

<p>*** In formal writing, use <em>literally</em> only to mean ‘in the exact sense; not figuratively’.</p>

<p>What I would like to see is an open-source plugin for popular word-processing applications that finds overused and discouraged words and phrases in a document, such as those mentioned earlier, and suggests corresponding replacements.  (A similar practice is found in Web browsers’ spell checkers and as a built-in feature in some closed source word-processing apps.)  For example, the plugin could look for instances of “sit down with”, underline them, and show suggestions such as “interview”, “consult with”, and so on in a menu when the phrase is selected for a language check.</p>

<h2 id="derivations">Derivations</h2>

<p>Derivations of existing words, so underused a procedure in our language, can enrich the vocabulary of English.</p>

<p>An interesting exercise to try with students is to build—</p>

<ul>
  <li>the feminine form of some words through suffixes.  For example, -an becomes -anesse, -ian becomes -ienne, -ican becomes -ickenne or -icanesse: <em>Bostonian</em> becomes <em>Bostonienne</em>, <em>American</em> becomes <em>Americkenne</em> or <em>Americanesse</em>, <em>Puerto Rican</em> becomes <em>Puerto Ricanesse</em> etc., instead of resorting to adding <em>female</em> or <em>woman</em>.</li>
  <li>the diminutive form of some words through suffixes (for example: -ie, -ette, -kin, -let) or through prefixes (for example: mini-, micro-), without resorting to adding <em>little</em> or <em>small</em>.</li>
</ul>
