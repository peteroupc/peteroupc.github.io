<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>This section describes certain math terms used on this page for programmers to understand.</p>

<p>The <em>closed unit interval</em> (written as [0, 1]) means the set consisting of 0, 1, and every real number in between.</p>

<p>The following terms can describe a function $f(x)$, specifically how &quot;well-behaved&quot; $f$ is &mdash; which can be important when designing Bernoulli factory algorithms.  This page mostly cares how $f$ behaves when its domain is the closed unit interval, that is, when $0 \le x \le 1$.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>continuous</em> function $f$ has the property that there is a function $h(x, \epsilon)$ (where $x$ is in $f$&#39;s domain and $\epsilon&gt;0$), such that $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are no more than $\epsilon$ apart whenever $x$ and $y$ are in $f$&#39;s domain and no more than $h(x, \epsilon)$ apart.<br>Roughly speaking, for each $x$ in $f$&#39;s domain, $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are &quot;close&quot; if $x$ and $y$ are &quot;close&quot; and belong in the domain.</li>
<li>If $f$ is continuous, its <em>derivative</em> is, roughly speaking, its &quot;slope&quot; function or &quot;velocity&quot; function or &quot;instantaneous-rate-of-change&quot; function.  The derivative (or <em>first derivative</em>) is denoted $f&#39;$ or $f^{(1)}$.  The <em>second derivative</em> (&quot;slope-of-slope&quot;) of $f$, denoted $f&#39;&#39;$ or $f^{(2)}$, is the derivative of $f&#39;$; the <em>third derivative</em>, denoted $f^{(3)}$, is the derivative of $f&#39;&#39;$; and so on.  The <em>0-th derivative</em> of a function $f$ is $f$ itself and denoted $f^{(0)}$.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder_condition"><strong><em>Hölder continuous</em></strong></a> function  (with <em>M</em> being the <em>Hölder constant</em> and <em>&alpha;</em> being the <em>Hölder exponent</em>) is a continuous function <em>f</em> such that <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) and <em>f</em>(<em>y</em>) are no more than <em>M</em>*<em>&delta;</em><sup><em>&alpha;</em></sup> apart whenever <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are in the function&#39;s domain and no more than <em>&delta;</em> apart.<br>Here, <em>&alpha;</em> satisfies 0 &lt; <em>&alpha;</em> &le; 1.<br>Roughly speaking, the function&#39;s &quot;steepness&quot; is no greater than that of <em>M</em>*<em>x</em><sup><em>&alpha;</em></sup>.</li>
<li>A <em>Lipschitz continuous</em> function with constant <em>L</em> (the <em>Lipschitz constant</em>) is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent 1 and Hölder constant <em>L</em>.<br>Roughly speaking, the function&#39;s &quot;steepness&quot; is no greater than that of <em>L</em>*<em>x</em>.<br>If the function has a derivative on its domain, <em>L</em> can be the maximum of the absolute value of that derivative.</li>
<li>A <em>convex</em> function $f$ has the property that $f((x+y)/2) \le (f(x)+f(y))/2$ whenever $x$, $y$, and $(x+y)/2$ are in the function&#39;s domain.<br>Roughly speaking, if the function&#39;s &quot;slope&quot; never goes down, then it&#39;s convex.</li>
<li>A <em>concave</em> function $f$ has the property that $f((x+y)/2) \ge (f(x)+f(y))/2$ whenever $x$, $y$, and $(x+y)/2$ are in the function&#39;s domain.<br>Roughly speaking, if the function&#39;s &quot;slope&quot; never goes up, then it&#39;s concave.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Factory Functions</h2>

<p>As a reminder, the <em>Bernoulli factory problem</em> is: Suppose there is a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability, <em>&lambda;</em>, and the goal is to use that coin (and possibly also a fair coin) to build a &quot;new&quot; coin that shows heads with a probability that depends on <em>&lambda;</em>, call it <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).</p>

<p>The algorithm for <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions"><strong>general factory functions</strong></a>, described in my main article on Bernoulli factory algorithms, works by building randomized upper and lower bounds for a function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), based on flips of the input coin.  Roughly speaking, the algorithm works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a random variate, <em>U</em>, uniformly distributed, greater than 0 and less than 1.</li>
<li>Flip the input coin, then build an upper and lower bound for <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), based on the outcomes of the flips so far.</li>
<li>If <em>U</em> is less than or equal to the lower bound, return 1. If <em>U</em> is greater than the upper bound, return 0.  Otherwise, go to step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>These randomized upper and lower bounds come from two sequences of polynomials as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>One sequence approaches the function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) from above, the other from below, and both sequences must converge to <em>f</em>.</li>
<li>For each sequence, the first polynomial has degree 1 (so is a linear function), and each other polynomial&#39;s degree is 1 higher than the previous.</li>
<li><p>The <em>consistency requirement</em> must be met, namely&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>the difference between the degree-(<em>n</em>&minus;1) upper polynomial and the degree-<em>n</em> upper polynomial, and</li>
<li>the difference between the degree-<em>n</em> lower polynomial and the degree-(<em>n</em>&minus;1) lower polynomial,</li>
</ul>

<p>must have nonnegative coefficients, once each of these differences is rewritten as a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly <em>n</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The consistency requirement ensures that the upper polynomials &quot;decrease&quot; and the lower polynomials &quot;increase&quot;.  Unfortunately, the reverse is not true in general; even if the upper polynomials &quot;decrease&quot; and the lower polynomials &quot;increase&quot; to <em>f</em>, this does not ensure the consistency requirement by itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example (Nacu &amp; Peres [2005][^1]):</strong> The polynomial $x^2+(1-x)^2$ is of degree 2 with Bernstein coefficients [1, 0, 1].  The polynomial $x(1-x)$ is of degree 2 with Bernstein coefficients [0, 1/2, 0]. Although $(x^2+(1-x)^2)$ minus $(x(1-x))$ is non-negative, this difference&#39;s Bernstein coefficients of degree 2 are not always non-negative, namely, the coefficients are [1, -1/2, 1].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this document, <strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) and <strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) mean the <em>k</em><sup>th</sup> coefficient for the lower or upper degree-<em>n</em> polynomial in Bernstein form, respectively, where 0 &le; <em>k</em> &le; <em>n</em> is an integer.</p>

<p>The section &quot;Building the Lower and Upper Polynomials&quot; are ways to build sequences of polynomials that appropriately converge to a factory function if that function meets certain conditions.</p>

<p>To determine if the methods are right for <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), a deep mathematical analysis of <em>f</em> is required; it would be helpful to plot that  function using a computer algebra system to see if it is described in the section &quot;Building the Upper and Lower Polynomials&quot;, later.</p>

<p>The next section gives examples of well-behaved functions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A Hölder continuous function with Hölder exponent <em>&alpha;</em> and Hölder constant <em>L</em> is also Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent <em>&beta;</em> and Hölder constant bounded above by <em>L</em>, where 0 &lt; <em>&beta;</em> &lt; <em>&alpha;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Finding parameters <em>&alpha;</em> and <em>L</em> for Hölder continuous functions.</strong> If $f(\lambda)$ is continuous, the following is one way to find the Hölder exponent (<em>&alpha;</em>) and Hölder constant (<em>L</em>) of $f$, to determine whether $f$ is Hölder continuous, not just continuous.</p>

<p>First, if $f$ has a continuous first derivative on its domain, then <em>&alpha;</em> is 1 ($f$ is <strong>Lipschitz continuous</strong>) and <em>L</em> is the maximum of the absolute value of that derivative.</p>

<p>Otherwise, consider the function $h(\lambda, c)=\text{abs}(f(\lambda)-f(c))/((\text{abs}(\lambda-c))^\alpha)$, or 0 if $\lambda=c$, where $0\lt\alpha\le 1$ is a Hölder exponent to test. For a given $\alpha$, let $g(\lambda)$ be the maximum of $h(\lambda,c)$ over all points $c$ where $f$ has a &quot;vertical slope&quot; or the &quot;steepest slope exhibited&quot;.  If $g(\lambda)$ is bounded for a given $\alpha$ on $f$&#39;s domain (in this case, the closed unit interval), then $f$ is Hölder continuous with Hölder exponent $\alpha$ and Hölder constant (<em>L</em>) equal to or greater than the maximum value of $g(\lambda)$ on its domain.</p>

<p>The following example, which uses the SymPy computer algebra library, plots $\max(h(\lambda,0),h(\lambda,1))$ when $f=\sqrt{\lambda(1-\lambda)}$ and $\alpha=1/2$: <code>lamda,c=symbols(&#39;lamda c&#39;); func=sqrt(lamda*(1-lamda)); alpha=S(1)/2; h=Abs(func-func.subs(lamda,c))/Abs(lamda-c)**alpha; plot(Max(h.subs(c,0),h.subs(c,1)),(lamda,0,1))</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Functions with a Hölder continuous or Lipschitz continuous derivative.</strong> The following table shows some functions whose derivatives are Hölder continuous, and others where that is not the case.  In the table below, if $f$ has a continuous <em>second</em> derivative on its domain, then <em>&alpha;</em> is 1 (the first derivative is Lipschitz continuous) and <em>L</em> is the maximum of the absolute value of that <em>second</em> derivative.</p>

<h3>Building the Lower and Upper Polynomials</h3>

<p>The rest of this section assumes <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is not a constant.  For examples of functions, see &quot;Examples of Well-Behaved Functions&quot;, earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Concave functions.</strong> If <em>f</em> is concave, then <strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) can equal <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>), thanks to Jensen&#39;s inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Convex functions.</strong> If <em>f</em> is convex, then <strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) can equal <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>), thanks to Jensen&#39;s inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Hölder and Lipschitz continuous functions.</strong> I have found a way to extend the results of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] to certain functions with a slope that tends to a vertical slope.  The following scheme, proved in the appendix, implements <strong>fabove</strong> and <strong>fbelow</strong> if <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder_condition"><strong><em>Hölder continuous</em></strong></a> on the closed unit interval, with Hölder constant <em>m</em> or less and Hölder exponent <em>&alpha;</em> (see &quot;<a href="#Definitions"><strong>Definitions</strong></a>&quot; as well as &quot;<a href="#Examples_of_Well_Behaved_Functions"><strong>Examples of Well-Behaved Functions</strong></a>&quot;, above), and</li>
<li>on the closed unit interval&mdash;

<ul>
<li>has a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1, or</li>
<li>is convex and has a minimum of greater than 0, or</li>
<li>is concave and has a maximum of less than 1.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For every integer <em>n</em> that&#39;s a power of 2:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>D</em>(<em>n</em>) = <em>m</em>*(2/7)<sup><em>&alpha;</em>/2</sup>/((2<sup><em>&alpha;</em>/2</sup>&minus;1)*<em>n</em><sup><em>&alpha;</em>/2</sup>).</li>
<li><strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) if <em>f</em> is concave; otherwise, min(<strong>fbelow</strong>(4,0), <strong>fbelow</strong>(4,1), ..., <strong>fbelow</strong>(4,4)) if <em>n</em> &lt; 4; otherwise, <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) &minus; <em>D</em>(<em>n</em>).</li>
<li><strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) if <em>f</em> is convex; otherwise, max(<strong>fabove</strong>(4,0), <strong>fabove</strong>(4,1), ..., <strong>fabove</strong>(4,4)) if <em>n</em> &lt; 4; otherwise, <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) + <em>D</em>(<em>n</em>).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  If <em>&alpha;</em> is 1, <em>D</em>(<em>n</em>) can be <em>m</em>*322613/(250000*sqrt(<em>n</em>)), which is an upper bound.  If <em>&alpha;</em> is 1/2, <em>D</em>(<em>n</em>) can be <em>m</em>*154563/(40000*<em>n</em><sup>1/4</sup>), which is an upper bound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Functions with a Lipschitz continuous derivative.</strong> The following method, proved in the appendix, implements <strong>fabove</strong> and <strong>fbelow</strong> if <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>has a Lipschitz continuous derivative (see &quot;<a href="#Definitions"><strong>Definitions</strong></a>&quot;), and</li>
<li>in the closed unit interval&mdash;

<ul>
<li>has a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1, or</li>
<li>is convex and has a minimum of greater than 0, or</li>
<li>is concave and has a maximum of less than 1.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Let <em>m</em> be the Lipschitz constant of <em>f</em>&#39;s derivative, or a greater number than that constant (if <em>f</em> has a second derivative on its domain, then <em>m</em> can be the maximum of the absolute value of that second derivative).  Then for every integer <em>n</em> that&#39;s a power of 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>For every $n$ such that <strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>,<em>k</em>) is 0 or greater for every <em>k</em>, <strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) if <em>f</em> is concave; otherwise, min(<strong>fbelow</strong>(4,0), <strong>fbelow</strong>(4,1), ..., <strong>fbelow</strong>(4,4)) if <em>n</em> &lt; 4; otherwise,  <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) &minus; <em>m</em>/(7*<em>n</em>).  For every other $n$, <strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>,<em>k</em>) = 0.</li>
<li>For every $n$ such that <strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>,<em>k</em>) is 1 or less for every <em>k</em>, <strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) if <em>f</em> is convex; otherwise, max(<strong>fabove</strong>(4,0), <strong>fabove</strong>(4,1), ..., <strong>fabove</strong>(4,4)) if <em>n</em> &lt; 4; otherwise, <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) + <em>m</em>/(7*<em>n</em>).  For every other $n$, <strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>,<em>k</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Certain functions that equal 0 at 0.</strong> This approach involves transforming the function <em>f</em> so that it no longer equals 0 at the point 0.  This can be done by dividing <em>f</em> by a function (<code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>)) that &quot;dominates&quot; <em>f</em> everywhere on the closed unit interval.  Unlike for the original function, there might be a polynomial-building scheme described earlier in this section for the transformed function.</p>

<p>More specifically, <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is continuous on the closed unit interval.</li>
<li><code>High</code>(0) = 0. (This is required to ensure correctness in case <em>&lambda;</em> is 0.)</li>
<li>1 &ge; <code>High</code>(1) &ge; <em>f</em>(1) &ge; 0.</li>
<li>1 &gt; <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) &gt; <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) &gt; 0 whenever 0 &lt; <em>&lambda;</em> &lt; 1.</li>
<li>If <em>f</em>(1) = 0, then <code>High</code>(1) = 0. (This is required to ensure correctness in case <em>&lambda;</em> is 1.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, <code>High</code> is a Bernoulli factory function that should admit a simple Bernoulli factory algorithm.  For example, <code>High</code> can be the following degree-<em>n</em> polynomial: 1&minus;(1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup>, where <em>n</em>&ge;1 is an integer.[^6]</p>

<p>The algorithm is now described.</p>

<p>Let <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = lim<sub><em>&nu;</em>&rarr;<em>&lambda;</em></sub> <em>f</em>(<em>&nu;</em>)/<code>High</code>(<em>&nu;</em>) (roughly speaking, the value that <em>f</em>(<em>&nu;</em>)/<code>High</code>(<em>&nu;</em>) approaches as <em>&nu;</em> approaches <em>&lambda;</em>.) If&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>f</em>(0) = 0 and <em>f</em>(1) &lt; 1, and</li>
<li><em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is continuous on the closed unit interval and belongs in one of the classes of functions given earlier,</li>
</ul>

<p>then <em>f</em> can be simulated using the following algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <code>High</code>.  If the call returns 0, return 0. (For example, if <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>, then this step amounts to the following: &quot;Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.&quot;)</li>
<li>Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>g</em>(.) and return the result of that algorithm.  This can be one of the <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions"><strong>general factory function algorithms</strong></a> if there is a way to calculate polynomials that converge to <em>g</em>(.) in a manner needed for that algorithm (for example, if <em>g</em> is described earlier in this section).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>It may happen that <em>g</em>(0) = 0.  In this case, step 2 of this algorithm can involve running this algorithm again, but with new <em>g</em> and <code>High</code> functions that are found based on the current <em>g</em> function. (This will eventually result in <em>g</em>(0) being nonzero if <em>f</em> is a nonconstant Bernoulli factory function.)   See the second example below.</li>
<li><code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) can also equal 1 instead of be described in this section.  That leads to the original Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = (sinh(<em>&lambda;</em>)+cosh(<em>&lambda;</em>)&minus;1)/4, then <em>f</em> is less than or equal to <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>, so <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is 1/4 if <em>&lambda;</em> = 0, and (exp(<em>&lambda;</em>) &minus; 1)/(4*<em>&lambda;</em>) otherwise.  The following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library computes this example: <code>fx = (sinh(x)+cosh(x)-1)/4; h = x; pprint(Piecewise((limit(fx/h,x,0), Eq(x,0)), ((fx/h).simplify(), True)))</code>.</li>
<li><p>If <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = cosh(<em>&lambda;</em>) &minus; 1, then <em>f</em> is less than or equal to <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>, so <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is 0 if <em>&lambda;</em> = 0, and (cosh(<em>&lambda;</em>)&minus;1)/<em>&lambda;</em> otherwise.  Now, since <em>g</em>(0) = 0, find new functions <em>g</em> and <code>High</code> based on the current <em>g</em>.  The current <em>g</em> is less than or equal to <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>*3*(2&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>)/5 (a degree-2 polynomial that in Bernstein form has coefficients [0, 6/10, 6/10]), so <em>G</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = 5/12 if <em>&lambda;</em> = 0, and &minus;(5*cosh(<em>&lambda;</em>) &minus; 5)/(3*<em>&lambda;</em><sup>2</sup>*(<em>&lambda;</em>&minus;2)) otherwise. <em>G</em> is bounded away from 0 and 1, resulting in the following algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Simulate <code>High</code>.) Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.</li>
<li>(Simulate <code>High</code>.) Flip the input coin twice.  If both flips return 0, return 0.  Otherwise, with probability 4/10 (that is, 1 minus 6/10), return 0.</li>
<li>Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>G</em> (which might involve building polynomials that converge to <em>G</em>, noticing that <em>G</em>&#39;s derivative is Lipschitz continuous) and return the result of that algorithm.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Certain functions that equal 0 at 0 and 1 at 1.</strong>  Let <em>f</em>, <em>g</em>, and <code>High</code> be functions as defined earlier, except that <em>f</em>(0) = 0 and <em>f</em>(1) = 1.  Define the following additional functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Low</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is a function that meets the following requirements:

<ul>
<li><code>Low</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is continuous on the closed unit interval.</li>
<li><code>Low</code>(0) = 0 and <code>Low</code>(1) = 1.</li>
<li>1 &gt; <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) &gt; <code>Low</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) &gt; 0 whenever 0 &lt; <em>&lambda;</em> &lt; 1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>q</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = lim<sub><em>&nu;</em>&rarr;<em>&lambda;</em></sub> <code>Low</code>(<em>&nu;</em>)/<code>High</code>(<em>&nu;</em>).</li>
<li><em>r</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = lim<sub><em>&nu;</em>&rarr;<em>&lambda;</em></sub> (1&minus;<em>g</em>(<em>&nu;</em>))/(1&minus;<em>q</em>(<em>&nu;</em>)).</li>
</ul>

<p>Roughly speaking, <code>Low</code> is a function that bounds <em>f</em> from below, just as <code>High</code> bounds <em>f</em> from above. <code>Low</code> is a Bernoulli factory function that should admit a simple Bernoulli factory algorithm; one example is the polynomial <em>&lambda;</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> where <em>n</em>&ge;1 is an integer.  If both <code>Low</code> and <code>High</code> are polynomials of the same degree, <em>q</em> will be a ratio of polynomials with a relatively simple Bernoulli factory algorithm (see &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Certain_Rational_Functions"><strong>Certain Rational Functions</strong></a>&quot;).</p>

<p>Now, if <em>r</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is continuous on the closed unit interval, then <em>f</em> can be simulated using the following algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <code>High</code>.  If the call returns 0, return 0. (For example, if <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>, then this step amounts to the following: &quot;Flip the input coin.  If it returns 0, return 0.&quot;)</li>
<li>Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>q</em>(.).  If the call returns 1, return 1.</li>
<li>Run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>r</em>(.), and return 1 minus the result of that call.  The Bernoulli factory algorithm can be one of the <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#General_Factory_Functions"><strong>general factory function algorithms</strong></a> if there is a way to calculate polynomials that converge to <em>r</em>(.) in a manner needed for that algorithm (for example, if <em>r</em> is described earlier in this section).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Quick proof: Rewrite $f=\text{High}\cdot(q\cdot1+(1-q)\cdot(1-r))+(1-\text{High})\cdot0$.</li>
<li><code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is allowed to equal 1 if the <em>r</em>(.) in step 3 is allowed to equal 0 at 0.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = (1&minus;exp(<em>&lambda;</em>))/(1&minus;exp(1)), then <em>f</em> is less than or equal to <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>, and greater than or equal to <code>Low</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em><sup>2</sup>.  As a result, <em>q</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>, and <em>r</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = (2 &minus; exp(1))/(1 &minus; exp(1)) if <em>&lambda;</em> = 0; 1/(exp(1)&minus;1) if <em>&lambda;</em> = 1; and (&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>*(1 &minus; exp(1)) &minus; exp(<em>&lambda;</em>) + 1)/(<em>&lambda;</em>*(1 &minus; exp(1))*(<em>&lambda;</em> &minus; 1)) otherwise.  This can be computed using the following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library: <code>fx=(1-exp(x))/(1-exp(1)); high=x; low=x**2; q=(low/high); r=(1-fx/high)/(1-q); r=Piecewise((limit(r, x, 0), Eq(x,0)), (limit(r,x,1),Eq(x,1)), (r,True)).simplify(); pprint(r)</code>.</p>

<h3>Another General Algorithm</h3>

<p>The algorithm I&#39;ve developed in this section simulates $f(\lambda)$ when $f$ belongs in a large class of functions, as long as the following is known:</p>

<ul>
<li>$f$ is continuous and has a minimum of greater than 0 and a maximum of less than 1.</li>
<li>There is a family of polynomials ($L_{1}(f)$, $L_{2}(f)$, $L_{4}(f)$, $L_{8}(f)$, ...) that come close to $f$ with a known error bound, where the number after $L$ is the degree of the polynomial.</li>
<li>There is a way to find the <em>Bernstein coefficients</em> of each polynomial $L_{n}(f)$ in the family of polynomials.</li>
</ul>

<p>For examples of suitable polynomials, see &quot;<a href="#Approximate_Bernoulli_Factories"><strong>Approximate Bernoulli Factories</strong></a>, later.</p>

<p>In effect, the algorithm writes $f$ as an infinite sum of polynomials, whose maximums must sum to 1 or less (called <em>T</em> in the algorithm below), then simulates an appropriate <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Convex_Combinations"><strong>convex combination</strong></a> of these polynomials.  To build the convex combination, each polynomial in the infinite sum is divided by an upper bound on its maximum (which is why error bounds on $L_{n}(f)$ are crucial here).[^7] To simulate $f$, the algorithm&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>selects a polynomial in the convex combination with probability proportional to its upper bound, or a &quot;leftover&quot; zero polynomial with probability <em>T</em>, then</li>
<li>simulates the chosen polynomial (which is easy to do; see Goyal and Sigman (2012)[^8]).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>In the algorithm, denote:

<ul>
<li>$\epsilon(f, n)$ as an upper bound on the absolute value of the difference between $f$ and the degree-$n$ polynomial $L_{n}(f)$. $\epsilon(f, n)$ must increase nowhere as $n$ increases, and must converge to 0.

<ul>
<li>For best results, this should be written as $\epsilon(f, n) = C/n^r$, where $C$ is a constant and $r&gt;0$ is a multiple of 1/2, since then it&#39;s easy to find the value of ErrShift(f, n), below.  In this case, the algorithm should be limited to functions with a continuous $(2r)$-th derivative or a Lipschitz continuous $(2r-1)$-th derivative (see &quot;<a href="#Achievable_Simulation_Rates"><strong>Achievable Simulation Rates</strong></a>&quot;, later).  (For example, if the error bound is $C/n^2$, the function $f$ should have a continuous fourth derivative or a Lipschitz continuous third derivative.)</li>
<li>For examples of error bounds, see &quot;Approximate Bernoulli Factories&quot;, later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ErrShift($f, m$) as 1.01 $\cdot\sum_{i\ge m} \epsilon(f, 2^i)$.  The factor 1.01 is needed to ensure each difference polynomial is strictly between 0 and 1.

<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If $\epsilon(f, n) = C/n^r$, then ErrShift($f, m)$ = $1.01\cdot C 2^r/(((2^r)-1)\cdot 2^{rm})$.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DiffWidth($f, m$) as 1.01 $\cdot 2 (\epsilon(f, 2^m)$ + $\epsilon(f, 2^{m+1}))$.  This is an upper bound on the maximum difference between the shifted degree-$2^m$ and the shifted degree-$(2^{m+1})$ polynomial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The technique breaks $f$ into a <strong>starting polynomial</strong> and a family of <strong>difference polynomials</strong>.<br>To find the <strong>starting polynomial</strong>:

<ol>
<li>Set $m$ to 0.</li>
<li>Find the Bernstein coefficients of $L_{2^m}$, then subtract ErrShift($f, m$) from them.  If the coefficients now all lie in the closed unit interval, go to the next step.  Otherwise, add 1 to <em>m</em> and repeat this step.</li>
<li>Calculate <strong>StartWidth</strong> as ceil($c\cdot 65536$)/65536, where $c$ is the maximum Bernstein coefficient from step 2, then divide each Bernstein coefficient by <strong>StartWidth</strong>. (65536 is arbitrary and ensures <strong>StartWidth</strong> is a rational number that is close to, but no lower than, the maximum Bernstein coefficient, for convenience.)</li>
<li>The <strong>starting polynomial</strong> now has Bernstein coefficients found in step 3.  Set <strong>StartOrder</strong> to <em>m</em>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To find the <strong>difference polynomial</strong> of order $m$:

<ol>
<li>Find the Bernstein coefficients of $L_{2^m}$, then subtract ErrShift($f, m$) from them.  Rewrite them to Bernstein coefficients of degree $2^{m+1}$.  Call the coefficients <strong>LowerCoeffs</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the Bernstein coefficients of $L_{2^{m+1}}$, then subtract ErrShift($f, m+1$) from them.  Call the coefficients <strong>UpperCoeffs</strong>.</li>
<li>Subtract <strong>UpperCoeffs</strong> from <strong>LowerCoeffs</strong>, and call the result <strong>DiffCoeffs</strong>.  Divide each coefficient in <strong>DiffCoeffs</strong> by DiffWidth($f, m$).  The result is the Bernstein coefficients of a positive polynomial of degree $2^{m+1}$ bounded by 0 and 1, but these coefficients are not necessarily bounded by 0 and 1.  Thus, if any coefficient in <strong>DiffCoeffs</strong> is less than 0 or greater than 1, add 1 to <em>m</em> and rewrite <strong>DiffCoeffs</strong> to Bernstein coefficients of degree $2^{m+1}$ until no coefficient is less than 0 or greater than 1 anymore.</li>
<li>The <strong>difference polynomial</strong> now has Bernstein coefficients given by <strong>DiffCoeffs</strong>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The probabilities for <em>X</em> are as follows:

<ul>
<li>First, find the <strong>starting polynomial</strong>, then calculate <em>T</em> as <strong>StartWidth</strong> + $\sum_{i\ge 0}$ DiffWidth($f$, <strong>StartOrder</strong>+<em>i</em>).  If <em>T</em> is greater than 1, this algorithm can&#39;t be used.

<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If $\epsilon(f, n) = C/n^r$, then <em>T</em> = <strong>StartWidth</strong> + 1.01 $\cdot(2 \cdot 2^{-r\cdot\text{StartOrder}} C (1 + 2^{- r}))/(1 - 2^{- r})$.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>X</em> is 0 with probability 1 &minus; <em>T</em>.</li>
<li><em>X</em> is 1 with probability equal to <strong>StartWidth</strong>.</li>
<li>For each <em>m</em> &ge; 2, <em>X</em> is <em>m</em> with probability equal to DiffWidth($f$,<strong>StartOrder</strong> + <em>m</em> &minus; 2).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Then an algorithm to toss heads with probability equal to $f$ would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate <em>X</em> at random with the probabilities given above.</li>
<li>If <em>X</em> is 0, return 0.  Otherwise, if <em>X</em> is 1, find the <strong>starting polynomial</strong> and its Bernstein coefficients.  Otherwise (if <em>X</em> is 2 or greater), find the <strong>difference polynomial</strong> of order <em>m</em> and its Bernstein coefficients, where <em>m</em> = (<em>X</em>&minus;2) + <strong>StartOrder</strong>.</li>
<li>Flip the input coin (with probability of heads $\lambda$), $n - 1$ times, where $n$ is the number of Bernstein coefficients in the polynomial found in step 2 (its degree plus one), and let $j$ be the number of heads.</li>
<li>Return 1 with probability equal to the polynomial&#39;s $j$th Bernstein coefficient ($j$ starts at 0), or 0 otherwise (see also Goyal and Sigman 2012 for an algorithm to simulate polynomials).</li>
</ol>

<p>If <em>T</em> turns out to be greater than 1 in this algorithm, but still finite, one way to simulate $f$ is to create a coin that simulates $f(\lambda)/T$ instead, and use that coin as the input to a <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Linear_Bernoulli_Factories"><strong><em>linear Bernoulli factory</em></strong></a> that simulates $T\cdot (f(\lambda)/T)$.  (This is possible especially because $f(\lambda)$ is assumed to have a maximum of less than 1.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: The following parameters allow this algorithm to work if $f$ is concave, has a maximum of less than 1, and has a Lipschitz-continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant <em>M</em> or less.  In this case, it is allowed that $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=0$, or both.</p>

<ul>
<li>The family of polynomials $L_n(f)$ is simply the family of Bernstein polynomials of $f$.  The Bernstein coefficients of $L_n(f)$ are $f(0/n), f(1/n), ..., f(n/n)$.</li>
<li>The error bound is $\epsilon(f, n) = M/(8n)$ (Lorentz 1963)[^9].</li>
<li>The <strong>starting polynomial</strong> is found as follows. Let <em>c</em> = max($f(0), f(1)$).  Then the starting polynomial has two Bernstein coefficients both equal to $c$; <strong>StartWidth</strong> is equal to ceil($c\cdot 65536$)/65536, and <strong>StartOrder</strong> is equal to 0.</li>
<li>ErrShift($f,m$) = 0. The reason for 0 is that $f$ is concave, so its Bernstein polynomials naturally &quot;increase&quot; with increasing degree (Temple 1954)[^10], (Moldovan 1962)[^11].</li>
<li>DiffWidth($f,m$) = $1.01\cdot 3 M/(8\cdot 2^m)$.  For the same reason as the previous point, and because the Bernstein polynomials are always &quot;below&quot; $f$, DiffWidth($f,m$) can also equal 1.01 $\cdot \epsilon(f, 2^{m})$ = $1.01\cdot M/(8\cdot 2^m)$.  This is what is used to calculate <em>T</em>, below.</li>
<li><em>T</em> is calculated as <strong>StartWidth</strong> + $1.01\cdot M/4$.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Request for Additional Methods</h3>

<p>Readers are requested to let me know of additional solutions to the following problem:</p>

<p><em>Let $f(\lambda)$ be continuous and satisfy $0\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1$ whenever $0\le\lambda\le 1$.  Given that $f(\lambda)$ belongs to a large class of functions (for example, it has a continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, or nowhere decreasing $k$-th derivative for some integer $k$, or any combination of these), compute the Bernstein coefficients for two sequences of polynomials as follows: one of them approaches $f(\lambda)$ from above, the other from below, and the consistency requirement must be met (see &quot;<a href="#General_Factory_Functions"><strong>General Factory Functions</strong></a>&quot;).</em></p>

<h2>Approximate Bernoulli Factories</h2>

<p>An <strong>approximate Bernoulli factory</strong> for a function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is a Bernoulli factory algorithm that simulates another function, <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), that approximates <em>f</em> in some sense.</p>

<p>Usually <em>g</em> is a polynomial, but can also be a rational function (ratio of polynomials) or another function with an easy-to-implement Bernoulli factory algorithm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) can be any function that maps the closed unit interval to itself, even if it isn&#39;t continuous or a factory function (examples include the &quot;step function&quot; 0 if <em>&lambda;</em> &lt; 1/2 and 1 otherwise, or the function 2*min(<em>&lambda;</em>, 1 &minus; <em>&lambda;</em>)).  If the function is continuous, it can be approximated arbitrarily well by an approximate Bernoulli factory (as a result of the so-called &quot;Weierstrass approximation theorem&quot;), but generally not if the function is discontinuous.</p>

<p>To build an approximate Bernoulli factory with a polynomial:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, find a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree <em>n</em> that is close enough to the desired function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).</p>

<p>The simplest choice for this polynomial, known simply as a <em>Bernstein polynomial</em>, has <em>n</em>+1 coefficients and its <em>j</em><sup>th</sup> coefficient (starting at 0) is found as <em>f</em>(<em>j</em>/<em>n</em>).  For this choice, if <em>f</em> is continuous, the polynomial can be brought arbitrarily close to <em>f</em> by choosing <em>n</em> high enough.</p>

<p>Other choices for this polynomial are given in the sections &quot;Polynomials as Approximate Bernoulli Factories&quot; and &quot;For &#39;Smooth&#39; Functions&quot;, later.</p>

<p>Whatever polynomial is used, the polynomial&#39;s coefficients must all lie on the closed unit interval.</p></li>
<li><p>The rest of the process is to toss heads with probability equal to that polynomial, given its coefficients.  To do this, first flip the input coin <em>n</em> times, and let <em>j</em> be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, with probability equal to the polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficient at position <em>j</em> (0&le;<em>j</em>&le;<em>n</em>), return 1.  Otherwise, return 0.  (This coefficient will be $f(j/n)$ in the case of the Bernstein polynomial $B_n(f)$.  If the coefficient can be an irrational number, see &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Algorithms_for_General_Irrational_Constants"><strong>Algorithms for General Irrational Constants</strong></a>&quot; for ways to exactly sample a probability equal to that irrational number.)</p></li>

<h3>Polynomials as Approximate Bernoulli Factories</h3>

<p>A polynomial of a high enough degree (called $n$) can be used to approximate $f(\lambda)$ with an error no more than $\epsilon$, as long as its Bernstein coefficients can be calculated and an explicit upper bound on the approximation error is available. See my <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/442057/explicit-and-fast-error-bounds-for-approximating-continuous-functions"><strong>question on MathOverflow</strong></a>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In addition, by analyzing the proof of Theorem 2.4 of Güntürk and Li (2021, sec. 3.3)[^14], the following error bounds for $U_{n, 3}$ <em>appear</em> to be true:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Bernstein polynomials ($B_n(f)$) have the advantages that only one Bernstein coefficient has to be found per run and that the coefficient will be bounded by 0 and 1 if $f(\lambda)$ is.  But their disadvantage is that they approach $f$ slowly in general, at a rate no faster than a rate proportional to $1/n$ (Voronovskaya 1932)[^24].</p>

<p>On the other hand, polynomials other than Bernstein polynomials ($B_n(f)$) can approach $f$ faster in many cases than $B_n(f)$, but are not necessarily bounded by 0 and 1.  For these polynomials, the following process can be used to calculate the required degree $n$, given an error tolerance of $\epsilon$.</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine whether $f$ is described in the table above.  Let <em>A</em> be the minimum of $f$ on the closed unit interval and let <em>B</em> be the maximum of $f$ there.</li>
<li>If 0 &lt; <em>A</em> &le; <em>B</em> &lt; 1, calculate $n$ as given in the table above, but with $\epsilon=\min(\epsilon, A, 1-B)$, and stop.</li>
<li>Propositions B1, B2, and B3 in the <a href="#Appendix"><strong>appendix</strong></a> give conditions on $f$ so that $W_{n,2}$ or $W_{n,3}$ (as the case may be) will be nonnegative.  If <em>B</em> is less than 1 and any of those conditions is met, calculate $n$ as given in the table above, but with $\epsilon=\min(\epsilon, 1-B)$. (For B3, set $n$ to max($n$, $m$), where $m$ is given in that proposition.) Then stop; $W_{n,2}$ or $W_{n,3}$ will now be bounded by 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Calculate $n$ as given in the table above.  Then, if any Bernstein coefficient of the resulting polynomial is less than 0 or greater than 1, double the value of $n$ until this condition is no longer true.</li>
</ol>

<p>The resulting polynomial of degree $n$ will be within $\epsilon$ of $f(\lambda)$.</p>

<h3>For &quot;Smooth&quot; Functions</h3>

<p>If $f(\lambda)$ is &quot;smooth&quot; enough on the closed unit interval and if $\epsilon$ is big enough, then Taylor&#39;s theorem shows how to build a polynomial that comes within $\epsilon$ of $f$. In this section $f$ may but need not be writable as a power series.</p>

<p>Let $n\ge 0$ be an integer, and let $f^{(i)}$ be the $i$-th derivative of $f(\lambda)$.  Suppose that&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>$f$ is continuous on the closed unit interval, and</li>
<li>$f$ satisfies $\epsilon\le f(0)\le 1-\epsilon$ and $\epsilon\le f(1)\le 1-\epsilon$, and</li>
<li>$f$ satisfies $\epsilon\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1-\epsilon$ whenever $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$, and</li>
<li>$f$&#39;s $(n+1)$-th derivative is continuous and satisfies $\epsilon\ge M/((n+1)!)$, where $M$ is not less than the maximum of the absolute value of that derivative, and</li>
<li>$f(0)$ is known as well as $f^{(1)}(0), ..., f^{(n)}(0)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the $n$-th <em>Taylor polynomial</em> centered at 0, given below, is within $\epsilon$ of $f$: $$P(\lambda) = a_0 \lambda^0 + a_1 \lambda^1 + ... + a_n \lambda^n,$$</p>

<p>where $a_0 = f(0)$ and $a_i = f^{(i)}(0)/(i!)$ for $i\ge 1$.  (Items 2 and 3 above are needed to ensure the Taylor polynomial can be simulated by a Bernoulli factory.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If $f(\lambda)$ can be rewritten as a power series, namely $f(\lambda) = c_0 \lambda^0 + c_1 \lambda^1 + ... + c_i \lambda^i + ...$ whenever $0\le\lambda\le 1$ (so that $f$ has a continuous $k$-th derivative for every $k$), and if the coefficients $c_i$&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>are each greater than 0,</li>
<li>form a nowhere increasing sequence (example: (1/4, 1/8, 1/8, 1/16, ...)), and</li>

</ul>

<p>then the algorithms in Carvalho and Moreira (2022)[^27] can be used to find the first $n$+1 coefficients such that $P(\lambda)$ is within $\epsilon$ of $f$ (see also &quot;<a href="#Proofs_on_Cutting_Off_a_Power_Series"><strong>Proofs on Cutting Off a Power Series</strong></a>&quot; in the appendix).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the polynomial $P$, the algorithm to simulate this polynomial is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rewrite $P(\lambda)$ as a polynomial in Bernstein form.  (One way to transform a polynomial to Bernstein form, given the &quot;power&quot; coefficients $a_0, ..., a_n$, is the so-called &quot;matrix method&quot; from Ray and Nataraj (2012)[^28].)  Let $b_0, ..., b_n$ be the Bernstein-form polynomial&#39;s coefficients.  If any of those coefficients is less than 0 or greater than 1, double the value of $n$ and rewrite $P$ to Bernstein form of degree $n$, until none of the coefficients is less than 0 or greater than 1.</li>
<li>Flip the input coin <em>n</em> times, then let <em>j</em> be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way, then return either 1 with probability $b_j$, or 0 otherwise.</li>

<h3>For Linear Functions</h3>

<li><p>Henderson and Glynn (2003, Remark 4)[^29] approximates the function <em>&lambda;</em>*2 using a polynomial of degree <em>n</em> where the <em>j</em><sup>th</sup> coefficient (starting at 0) is min((<em>j</em>/<em>n</em>)*2, 1&minus;1/<em>n</em>).  If <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is that polynomial, then the error in approximating <em>f</em> is no greater than 1&minus;<em>g</em>(1/2).  <em>g</em> can be computed with the SymPy computer algebra library as follows: <code>from sympy.stats import *; g=2*E( Min(sum(Bernoulli((&quot;B%d&quot; % (i)),z) for i in range(n))/n,(S(1)-S(1)/n)/2))</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>An algorithm given in section 6 of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] approximates <em>&lambda;</em>*2: Flip the input coin <em>n</em> times or until the ratio of &quot;heads&quot; to &quot;flips&quot; becomes at least 1/2, whichever comes first, then if <em>n</em> flips were made without the ratio becoming at least 1/2, return 0; otherwise, return 1.  Here, <em>&lambda;</em>*2 is approximated by a polynomial of degree <em>n</em> where the <em>j</em><sup>th</sup> coefficient (starting at 0) is min((<em>j</em>/<em>i</em>)*2, 1).  If <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is that polynomial, then the error in approximating <em>f</em> is no greater than 1&minus;<em>g</em>(1/2).</p></li>

<p>[^3]: Thomas and Blanchet (2012) dealt with building polynomials that approach piecewise linear functions &quot;fast&quot;.  Their strategy for $f(\lambda)=\min(mult\times\lambda, 1-2\varepsilon)$ is to first compute a low-degree polynomial $P$ satisfying $P(0)=0$ and otherwise greater than $f$, and then compute further polynomials of increasing degree that each come between $f$ and the previous polynomial and satisfy the consistency requirement. These polynomials approach $f$ rapidly when $\lambda$ is near 0, and extremely slowly when $\lambda$ is near 1. In their strategy, <strong>fbelow(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>)</strong> is min((<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>)*<em>mult</em>, 1&minus;<em>&epsilon;</em>), and <strong>fabove(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>)</strong> is min((<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>)*<em>y</em>/<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>), where:<br><em>x</em> = &minus;((<em>y</em>&minus;(1&minus;<em>&epsilon;</em>))/<em>&epsilon;</em>)<sup>5</sup>/<em>mult</em> + <em>y</em>/<em>mult</em>. (This formula doesn&#39;t appear in their paper, but in the <a href="https://github.com/acthomasca/rberfac/blob/main/rberfac-public-2.R"><strong>supplemental source code</strong></a> uploaded by A. C. Thomas at my request.)<br><em>y</em> satisfies 0&lt;<em>y</em>&lt;1 and is chosen so that the degree-<em>n</em> polynomial is between $f$ and the previous polynomial and meets the consistency requirement. The supplemental source code seems to choose <em>y</em> in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner.<br><em>n</em> is the polynomial&#39;s degree.</p>

<p>[^4]: In Nacu and Peres (2005), the following polynomial sequences were suggested to simulate $\min(2\lambda, 1-2\varepsilon)$ (using the algorithms from the section &quot;General Factory Functions&quot; in &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html"><strong>Bernoulli Factory Algorithms</strong></a>&quot;), provided $\varepsilon \lt 1/8$, where <em>n</em> is a power of 2.  However, with these sequences, each simulation will require an extraordinary number of input coin flips. <strong>fbelow(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>)</strong> = $\min(2(k/n), 1-2\varepsilon)$. <strong>fabove(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>)</strong> = $\min(2(k/n), 1-2\varepsilon)$ + $\frac{2\times\max(0, k/n+3\varepsilon - 1/2)}{\varepsilon(2-\sqrt{2})}$ $\sqrt{2/n}$ + $\frac{72\times\max(0,k/n-1/9)}{1-\exp(-2\times\varepsilon^2)} \exp(-2n\times\varepsilon^2)$.</p>

<p>[^5]: This function&#39;s second derivative&#39;s absolute value can be plotted using the SymPy library as follows: <code>plot(diff(Abs(exp(-x)),(x,2)),(x,0,1))</code>.  In this plot, the maximum is 1, the same as the first derivative&#39;s Lipschitz constant.</p>

<p>[^6]: In this case, an algorithm to simulate <code>High</code>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is: Flip the input coin <em>n</em> times or until a flip returns 1, whichever comes first, then output the last coin flip result.</p>

<p>[^7]: With this infinite sum and these upper bounds, Lemma 4 of Holtz et al. (2011) says that a Bernoulli factory algorithm for $f(\lambda)$ is possible.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p><a id=Proofs_on_Cutting_Off_a_Power_Series></a></p>

<h3>Proofs on Cutting Off a Power Series</h3>

<p><strong>Lemma A1:</strong> Let&mdash; $$f(x)=a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + ...,$$ where the $a_i$ are constants each 0 or greater and sum to a finite value and where $0\le x\le 1$ (the domain is the closed unit interval). Then $f$ is convex and has a maximum at 1.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> By inspection, $f(x)$ is a power series and is nonnegative wherever $x\ge 0$ (and thus wherever $0\le x\le 1$).  Each of its terms has a maximum at 1 since&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>for $n=0$, $a_0 x^0=a_0$ is a non-negative constant (which trivially reaches its maximum at 1), and</li>
<li>for each $n$ where $a_0 = 0$, $a_0 x^n$ is the constant 0 (which trivially reaches its maximum at 1), and</li>
<li>for each other $n$, $x^n$ is a strictly increasing function and multiplying that by $a_n$ (a positive constant) doesn&#39;t change whether it&#39;s strictly increasing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since all of these terms have a maximum at 1 on the domain, so does their sum.</p>

<p>The derivative of $f$ is&mdash; $$f&#39;(x) = 1\cdot a_1 x^0 + ... + i\cdot a_i x^{i-1} + ...,$$ which is still a power series with nonnegative values of $a_n$, so the proof so far applies to $f&#39;$ instead of $f$.  By induction, the proof so far applies to all derivatives of $f$, including its second derivative.</p>

<p>Now, since the second derivative is nonnegative wherever $x\ge 0$, and thus on its domain, $f$ is convex, which completes the proof. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition A2:</strong> For a function $f(x)$ as in Lemma A1, let&mdash; $$g_n(x)=a_0 x^0 + ... + a_n x^n,$$ and have the same domain as $f$.  Then for every $n\ge 1$, $g_n(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ of $f(x)$, where $\epsilon = f(1) - g_n(1)$.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> $g_n$, consisting of the first $n+1$ terms of $f$, is a power series with nonnegative coefficients, so by Lemma A1, it has a maximum at 1.  The same is true for $f-g_n$, consisting of the remaining terms of $f$.  Since the latter has a maximum at 1, the maximum error is $\epsilon = f(1)-g_n(1)$. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>For a function $f$ described in Lemma A1, $f(1)=a_0 1^0 + a_1 1^1 + ... = a_0 + a_1+...$, and $f$&#39;s error behavior is described at the point 1, so the algorithms given in Carvalho and Moreira (2022)[^27] &mdash; which apply to infinite sums &mdash; can be used to &quot;cut off&quot; $f$ at a certain number of terms and do so with a controlled error.</p>

<h3>Results Used in Approximate Bernoulli Factories</h3>

<p><strong>Proposition B1</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ map the closed unit interval to itself and be continuous and concave.  Then $W_{n,2}$ and $W_{n,3}$ (as defined in &quot;For Certain Functions&quot;) are nonnegative on the closed unit interval.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> For $W_{n,2}$ it&#39;s enough to prove that $B_n(f)\le f$ for every $n\ge 1$.  This is the case because of Jensen&#39;s inequality and because $f$ is concave.</p>

<p>For $W_{n,3}$ it must also be shown that $B_n(B_n(f(\lambda)))$ is nonnegative.  For this, using only the fact that $f$ maps the closed unit interval to itself, $B_n(f)$ will have Bernstein coefficients in that interval (each coefficient is a value of $f$) and so will likewise map the closed unit interval to itself (Qian et al. 2011)[^32].  Thus, by induction, $B_n(B_n(f(\lambda)))$ is nonnegative.  The discussion for $W_{n,2}$ also shows that $(f - B_n(f))$ is nonnegative as well.  Thus, $W_{n,3}$ is nonnegative on the closed unit interval. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B2</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ map the closed unit interval to itself, be continuous, nowhere decreasing, and subadditive, and equal 0 at 0. Then $W_{n,2}$ is nonnegative on the closed unit interval.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> The assumptions on $f$ imply that $B_n(f)\le 2 f$ (Li 2000)[^33], showing that $W_{n,2}$ is nonnegative on the closed unit interval.  &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A subadditive function $f$ has the property that $f(a+b) \le f(a)+f(b)$ whenever $a$, $b$, and $a+b$ are in $f$&#39;s domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proposition B3</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ map the closed unit interval to itself and have a Lipschitz continuous derivative with Lipschitz constant $L$.  If $f(\lambda) \ge \frac{L \lambda(1-\lambda)}{2m}$ on $f$&#39;s domain, for some $m\ge 1$, then $W_{n,2}$ is nonnegative there, for every $n\ge m$.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Let $E(\lambda, n) = \frac{L \lambda(1-\lambda)}{2n}$. Lorentz (1963)[^9] showed that with this Lipschitz derivative assumption on $f$, $B_n$ differs from $f(\lambda)$ by no more than $E(\lambda, n)$ for every $n\ge 1$ and wherever $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$.  As is well known, $B_n(0)=f(0)$ and $B_n(1)=f(1)$.  By inspection, $E(\lambda, n)$ is biggest when $n=1$ and decreases as $n$ increases. Assuming the worst case that $B_n(\lambda) = f(\lambda) + E(\lambda, m)$, it follows that $W_{n,2}=2 f(\lambda) - B_n(\lambda)\ge 2 f(\lambda) - f(\lambda) - E(\lambda, m) = f(\lambda) - E(\lambda, m)\ge 0$ whenever $f(\lambda)\ge E(\lambda, m)$.  Because $E(\lambda, k+1)\le E(\lambda,k)$ for every $k\ge 1$, the preceding sentence holds true for every $n\ge m$. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>The following results deal with a useful quantity when discussing the error in approximating a function by Bernstein polynomials.  Suppose a coin shows heads with probability $p$, and $n$ independent tosses of the coin are made.  Then the total number of heads $X$ follows a <em>binomial distribution</em>, and the $r$-th central moment of that distribution is as follows: $$T_{n,r}(p) = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^r] = \sum_{k=0}^n (k-np)^r{n \choose k}p^k (1-p)^{n-k},$$ where $\mathbb{E}[.]$ is the expected value (&quot;long-run average&quot;).   (Traditionally, another central moment, that of $X/n$ or the ratio of heads to tosses, is denoted $S_{n,r}(p)=T_{n,r}(p)/n^r=\mathbb{E}[(X/n-\mathbb{E}[X/n])^r]$.  $T$ and $S$ are notations of S.N. Bernstein, known for Bernstein polynomials.) The following results bound the absolute value of $T$ and $S$.[^34]</p>

<p><strong>Result B4</strong> (Molteni (2022)[^35]): If $r$ is an even integer such that $0\le r\le 44$, then for every integer $n\ge 1$, $|T_{n,r}(p)|\le (r!)/(((r/2)!)8^{r/2}) n^{r/2}$ and $|S_{n,r}(p)| \le (r!)/(((r/2)!)8^{r/2})\cdot(1/n^{r/2})$.</p>

<p><strong>Result B4A</strong> (Adell et al. (2015)[^36]):  For every odd integer $r\ge 1$, $T_{n,r}(p)$ is positive whenever $0\le p\le 1/2$, and negative whenever $1/2\le p\le 1$.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma B5</strong>: For every integer $n\ge 1$:</p>

<ul>
<li>$|S_{n,0}(p)|=1=1\cdot(p(1-p)/n)^{0/2}$.</li>
<li>$|S_{n,1}(p)|=0=0\cdot(p(1-p)/n)^{1/2}$.</li>
<li>$|S_{n,2}(p)|=p(1-p)/n=1\cdot(p(1-p)/n)^{2/2}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proof is straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Result B6</strong> (Adell and Cárdenas-Morales (2018)[^37]): Let $\sigma(r,t) = (r!)/(((r/2)!)t^{r/2})$.  If $r\ge 0$ is an even integer, then&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>for every integer $n\ge 1$, $|T_{n,r}(p)|\le \sigma(r,6)n^{r/2}$ and $|S_{n,r}(p)| \le \sigma(r,6)/n^{r/2}$, and</li>
<li>for every integer $n\ge 1$, $|T_{n,r}(1/2)|\le \sigma(r,8)n^{r/2}$ and $|S_{n,r}(1/2)| \le \sigma(r,8)/n^{r/2}$.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lemma B9</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Lipschitz continuous $r$-th derivative on the closed unit interval (see &quot;<a href="#Definitions"><strong>Definitions</strong></a>&quot;), where $r\ge 0$ is an integer, and let $M$ be equal to or greater than the $r$-th derivative&#39;s Lipschitz constant.  Then, for every $0\le x_0 \le 1$:</p>

<ol>
<li>$f$ can be written as $f(\lambda) = R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0) + f(x_0) + \sum_{i=1}^{r} (\lambda-x_0)^i f^{(i)}(x_0)/(i!)$ where $f^{(i)}$ is the $i$-th derivative of $f$.</li>
<li>If $r$ is odd, $|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le M/((((r+1)/2)!)(\beta n)^{(r+1)/2})$ for every integer $n\ge 1$, where $\beta$ is 8 if $r\le 43$ and 6 otherwise.</li>
<li>If $r=0$, $|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le M/(2n^{1/2})$ for every integer $n\ge 1$.</li>
<li>If $r$ is even and greater than 0, $|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!n^{(r+1)/2}}\left(\frac{2\cdot(r+1)!(r)!}{\gamma^{r+1}((r/2)!)^2}\right)^{1/2}$ for every integer $n\ge 2$, where $\gamma$ is 8 if $r\le 42$ and 6 otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof</em>: The well-known result of part 1 says $f$ equals the <em>Taylor polynomial</em> of degree $r$ at $x_0$ plus the <em>Lagrange remainder</em>,  $R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)$. A result found in Gonska et al. (2006)[^38], which applies for any integer $r\ge 0$, bounds that Lagrange remainder [^39].  By that result, because $f$&#39;s $r$-th derivative is Lipschitz continuous&mdash; $$|R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)|\le \frac{|\lambda-x_0|^r}{r!} M \frac{|\lambda-x_0|}{r+1}=M\frac{|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}}{(r+1)!}.$$</p>

<p>The goal is now to bound the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$.  This is easiest to do if $r$ is odd.</p>

<p>If $r$ is odd, then $(\lambda-x_0)^{r+1} = |\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$, so by Results B4 and B6, the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$ can be bounded as follows: $$|B_n((\lambda-x_0)^{r+1})(x_0)| \le \frac{(r+1)!}{(((r+1)/2)!)\beta^{(r+1)/2}}\frac{1}{n^{(r+1)/2}} = \sigma(r,n),$$ where $\beta$ is 8 if $r\le 43$ and 6 otherwise.  Therefore&mdash; $$|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!} |B_n((\lambda-x_0)^{r+1})(x_0)|$$ $$\le \frac{M}{(r+1)!}\frac{(r+1)!}{(((r+1)/2)!)\beta^{(r+1)/2}}\frac{1}{n^{(r+1)/2}} = \frac{M}{(((r+1)/2)!)(\beta n)^{(r+1)/2}}.$$</p>

<p>If $r$ is 0, then the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{1}$ is bounded by $\sqrt{x_0(1-x_0)/n}$ for every integer $n\ge 1$ (Cheng 1983)[^40], so&mdash; $$|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!}\sqrt{x_0(1-x_0)/n}\le \frac{M}{(r+1)!}\frac{1}{2n^{1/2}}=\frac{M}{2n^{1/2}}.$$</p>

<p>If $r$ is even and greater than 0, the Bernstein polynomial for $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$ can be bounded as follows for every $n\ge 2$, using <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchwarzsInequality.html"><strong>Schwarz&#39;s inequality</strong></a> (see also Bojanic and Shisha [1975][^41] for the case $r=4$): $$B_n(|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1})(x_0)=B_n((|\lambda-x_0|^{r/2}|\lambda-x_0|^{(r+2)/2})^2)(x_0)$$ $$\le\sqrt{|S_{n,r}(x_0)|}\sqrt{|S_{n,r+2}(x_0)|}\le\sqrt{\sigma(r,n)}\sqrt{\sigma(r+2,n)}$$ $$\le\frac{1}{n^{(r+1)/2}}\left(\frac{2\cdot(r+1)!(r)!}{\gamma^{r+1}((r/2)!)^2}\right)^{1/2},$$where $\gamma$ is 8 if $r\le 42$ and 6 otherwise. Therefore&mdash; $$|B_n(R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)| \le \frac{M}{(r+1)!\cdot n^{(r+1)/2}}\left(\frac{2\cdot(r+1)!(r)!}{\gamma^{r+1}((r/2)!)^2}\right)^{1/2}. $$&#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If a function $f(\lambda)$ has a continuous $r$-th derivative on its domain (where $r\ge 0$ is an integer), then by Taylor&#39;s theorem for real variables, $R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)$, is writable as $f^{(r)}(c)\cdot (\lambda-x_0)^r /(r!),$ for some $c$ between $\lambda$ and $x_0$ (and thus on $f$&#39;s domain) (DLMF [^42] <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.4.E36"><strong>equation 1.4.36</strong></a>).  Thus, by this estimate, $|R_{f,r}(\lambda, x_0)| \le \frac{M}{r!} (\lambda-x_0)^r.$</li>
<li>It would be interesting to strengthen this lemma, at least for $r\le 10$, with a bound of the form $MC\cdot\max(1/n, (x_0(1-x_0)/n)^{1/2})^{r+1}$, where $C$ is an explicitly given constant depending on $r$, which is possible because the Bernstein polynomial of $|\lambda-x_0|^{r+1}$ can be bounded in this way (Lorentz 1966)[^19].</li>

<p><strong>Proposition B10</strong>: Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Lipschitz continuous third derivative on the closed unit interval.  For each $n\ge 4$ that is divisible by 4, let $L_{3,n/4}(f) = (1/3)\cdot B_{n/4}(f) - 2\cdot B_{n/2}(f) + (8/3)\cdot B_{n}(f)$.  Then $L_{3,n/4}(f)$ is within $M/(8 n^2)$ of $f$, where $M$ is the maximum of the absolute value of that fourth derivative.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: This proof is inspired by the proof technique in Tachev (2022)[^15].</p>

<p>Because $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous third derivative, $f$ has the Lagrange remainder $R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0)$ given in Lemma B9 and Corollary B9A.</p>

<p>It is known that $L_{3,n/4}$ is a linear operator that preserves polynomials of degree 3 or less, so that $L_{3,n/4}(f) = f$ whenever $f$ is a polynomial of degree 3 or less (Ditzian and Totik 1987)[^43], Butzer (1955)[^16], May (1976)[^44].  Because of this, it can be assumed without loss of generality that $f(x_0)=0$.</p>

<p>Therefore&mdash;$$|L_{3,n/4}(f(\lambda))(x_0) - f(x_0)| = |L_{3,n/4}(R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0))|.$$ Now denote $\sigma_n$ as the maximum of $|B_n(R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0))(x_0)|$ over $0\le x_0\le 1$.  In turn (using Corollary B9A)&mdash; $$|L_{3,n/4}(R_{f,3}(\lambda, x_0))| \le(1/3)\cdot\sigma_{n/4} + 2\cdot\sigma_{n/2}+(8/3)\cdot\sigma_n$$ $$\le (1/3)\frac{M}{128 (n/4)^2} + 2\frac{M}{128 (n/2)^2} + (8/3)\frac{M}{128 n^2} =M/(8 n^2).$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B10A:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Lipschitz continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval.  Let $Q_{n,2}(f)=B_n(f)(x)-\frac{x(1-x)}{2n} B_n(f&#39;&#39;)(x)$ be the <em>Lorentz operator</em> of order 2 (Holtz et al. 2011)[^17], (Lorentz 1966)[^19], which is a polynomial of degree $n+2$.  Then if $n\ge 2$ is an integer, $Q_{n,2}(f)$ is within $\frac{M(\sqrt{3}+3)}{48 n^{3/2}} \lt 0.098585 M/(n^{3/2})$ of $f$, where $M$ is that second derivative&#39;s Lipschitz constant or greater.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Since $Q_{n,2}(f)$ preserves polynomials of degree 2 or less (Holtz et al. 2011, Lemma 14)[^17] and since $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous second derivative, $f$ has the Lagrange remainder $R_{f,2}(\lambda, x_0)$ given in Lemma B9, and $f&#39;&#39;$, the second derivative of $f$, has the Lagrange remainder $R_{f&#39;&#39;,0}(\lambda, x_0)$.  Thus, using Corollary B9A, the error bound can be written as&mdash; $$|Q_{n,2}(f(\lambda))(x_0) - f(x_0)|\le|B_n(R_{f,2}(\lambda, x_0))| + \frac{x_0(1-x_0)}{2n} |B_n(R_{f&#39;&#39;,0}(\lambda,x_0))|$$ $$\le \frac{\sqrt{3}M}{48 n^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{8n} \frac{M}{2 n^{1/2}} = \frac{M(\sqrt{3}+3)}{48 n^{3/2}} \lt 0.098585 M/(n^{3/2}).$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Corollary B10B:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval.  Then $B_n(f)$ is within $\frac{M}{8n}$ of $f$, where $M$ is the maximum of that second derivative&#39;s absolute value or greater.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Follows from Lorentz (1963)[^9] and the well-known fact that $M$ is an upper bound of $f$&#39;s first derivative&#39;s (minimal) Lipschitz constant. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>In the following propositions, $f^{(r)}$ means the $r$-th derivative of the function $f$ and $\max(|f|)$ means the maximum of the absolute value of the function $f$.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B10C:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Hölder continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval, with Hölder exponent $\alpha$ ($0\lt\alpha\le 1$) and Hölder constant $L$ or less.  Let $U_{n,2}(f)=B_n(2f-B_n(f))$ be $f$&#39;s iterated Boolean sum of order 2 of Bernstein polynomials.  Then if $n\ge 3$ is an integer, the error in approximating $f$ with $U_{n,2}(f)$ is as follows: $$|f-U_{n,2}(f)|\le \frac{M_2}{8 n^{2}} + 5 L/(32 n^{1+\alpha/2}) \le ((5L+4M_2)/32)/n^{1+\alpha/2},$$ where $M_2$ is the maximum of that second derivative&#39;s absolute value or greater.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: This proof is inspired by a result in Draganov (2004, Theorem 4.1)[^45].</p>

<p>The error to be bounded can be expressed as $|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|$.  Following Corollary B10B: $$|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|\le \frac{1}{8n} \max(|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}|).\tag{B10C-1}$$ It thus remains to estimate the right-hand side of the bound.  A result by Knoop and Pottinger (1976)[^46], which works for every $n\ge 3$, is what is known as a <em>simultaneous approximation</em> error bound, showing that the second derivative of the Bernstein polynomial approaches that of $f$ as $n$ increases.  Using this result: $$|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}| \le \frac{1}{n} M_2+(5/4) L/n^{\alpha/2},$$ so&mdash; $$|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|\le \frac{1}{8n} \left(\frac{1}{n} M_2+(5/4) L/n^{\alpha/2}\right)$$ $$\le \frac{M_2}{8 n^{2}} + \frac{5L}{32 n^{1+\alpha/2}}\le \frac{5L+4M_2}{32}\frac{1}{n^{1+\alpha/2}}.$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The error bound $0.75 M_2/n^2$ for $U_{n,2}$ is false in general if $f(\lambda)$ is assumed only to be non-negative, concave, and have a continuous second derivative on the closed unit interval.  A counterexample is $f(\lambda)=(1-(1-2\lambda)^{2.5})/2$ if $\lambda &lt;1/2$ and $(1-(2\lambda-1)^{2.5})/2$ otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proposition B10D:</strong> Let $f(\lambda)$ have a Hölder continuous third derivative on the closed unit interval, with Hölder exponent $\alpha$ ($0\lt\alpha\le 1$) and Hölder constant $L$ or less.  If $n\ge 6$ is an integer, the error in approximating $f$ with $U_{n,2}(f)$ is as follows: $$|f-U_{n,2}(f)|\le \frac{\max(|f^{(2)}|)+\max(|f^{(3)}|)}{8n^2}+9L/(64 n^{(3+\alpha)/2})$$ $$\le \frac{9L+8\max(|f^{(2)}|)+8\max(|f^{(3)}|)}{64n^{(3+\alpha)/2}}.$$</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Again, the goal is to estimate the right-hand side of (B10C-1).  But this time, a different simultaneous approximation bound is employed, namely a result from Kacsó (2002)[^47], which in this case works if $n\ge\max(r+2,(r+1)r)=6$, where $r=2$. By that result: $$|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}| \le \frac{r(r-1)}{2n} M_2+\frac{r M_3}{2n}+\frac{9}{8}\omega_2(f^{(2)},1/n^{1/2})$$ $$\le \frac{1}{n} M_2+M_3/n+\frac{9}{8} L/n^{(1+\alpha)/2},$$ where $r=2$, $M_2 = \max(|f^{(2)}|)$, and $M_3=\max(|f^{(3)}|)$, using properties of $\omega_2$, the second-order modulus of continuity of $f^{(2)}$, given in Stancu et al. (2001)[^48].  Therefore&mdash; $$|(B_n(f)-f)( B_n(f)-f )|\le \frac{1}{8n} \left(\frac{1}{n} M_2+M_3/n+\frac{9}{8} L/n^{(1+\alpha)/2}\right)$$ $$\le \frac{M_2+M_3}{8n^2} + \frac{9L}{64 n^{(3+\alpha)/2}}\le \frac{9L+8M_2+8M_3}{64n^{(3+\alpha)/2}}.$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p>In a similar way, it&#39;s possible to prove an error bound for $U_{n,3}$ that applies to functions with a Hölder continuous fourth or fifth derivative, by expressing the error bound as $|(B_n(f)-f)((B_n(f)-f)(B_n(f)-f))|$ and replacing the values for $M_2$, $M_3$, and $L$ in the bound proved at the end of Proposition B10D with upper bounds for $|(B_n(f))^{(2)}-f^{(2)}|$, $|(B_n(f))^{(3)}-f^{(3)}|$, and $|(B_n(f))^{(4)}-f^{(4)}|$, respectively.</p>

<h3>Chebyshev Interpolants</h3>

<p>The following is a method that employs <em>Chebyshev interpolants</em> to compute the Bernstein coefficients of a polynomial that comes within $\epsilon$ of $f(\lambda)$, as long as $f$ meets certain conditions.  Because the method introduces a trigonometric function (the cosine function), it appears here in the appendix and it runs too slowly for real-time or &quot;online&quot; use; rather, this method is more suitable for pregenerating (&quot;offline&quot;) the approximate version of a function known in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li>$f$ must be continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and must have an $r$-th derivative of <em>bounded variation</em>, as described later.</li>
<li><p>Suppose $f$&#39;s domain is the interval $[a, b]$.  Then the <em>Chebyshev interpolant</em> of degree $n$ of $f$ (Wang 2023)[^49], (Trefethen 2013)[^50] is&mdash; $$p(\lambda)=\sum_{k=0}^n c_k T_k(2\frac{\lambda-a}{b-a}-1),$$ where&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>$c_k=\sigma(k,n)\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=0}^n \sigma(j,n) f(\gamma(j,n))T_k(\cos(j\pi/n))$,</li>
<li>$\gamma(j,n) = a+(b-a)(\cos(j\pi/n)+1)/2$,</li>
<li>$\sigma(k,n)$ is 1/2 if $k$ is 0 or $n$, and 1 otherwise, and</li>
<li>$T_k(x)$ is the $k$-th <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebyshevPolynomialoftheFirstKind.html"><strong>Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind</strong></a> (<code>chebyshevt(k,x)</code> in the SymPy computer algebra library).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let $r\ge 1$ and $n\gt r$ be integers. If $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $f$ has an $r$-th derivative of <em>bounded variation</em>, then the degree-$n$ Chebyshev interpolant of $f$ is within $\left(\frac{(b-a)}{2}\right)^r\frac{4V}{\pi r(n-r)^r}$ of $f$, where $V$ is the $r$-th derivative&#39;s <em>total variation</em> or greater.  This relies on a theorem in chapter 7 of Trefethen (2013)[^50] as well as a statement in note 1 at the end of this section.

<ul>
<li>If the $r$-th derivative is nowhere decreasing or nowhere increasing on the interval $[a, b]$, then $V$ can equal abs($f(b)-f(a)$).</li>
<li>If the $r$-th derivative is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $M$ or less, then $V$ can equal $M\cdot(b-a)$ (Kannan and Kreuger 1996)[^51].</li>
<li>The required degree is thus $n=\text{ceil}(r+\frac{(b-a)}{2}(4V/(\pi r\epsilon))^{1/r})$ &le; $\text{ceil}(r+\frac{(b-a)}{2}(1.2733 V/(r\epsilon))^{1/r})$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the desired error tolerance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If $f$ is real analytic on $[a, b]$, a better error bound is possible, but describing it requires ideas from complex analysis that are too advanced for this article.  See chapter 8 of Trefethen (2013)[^50].</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Compute the required degree $n$ as given above, with error tolerance $\epsilon/2$.</li>
<li>Compute the ($n$ plus one) coefficients of $f$&#39;s degree-$n$ Chebyshev interpolant, call them $c_0, ..., c_n$.</li>
<li>Compute the (<em>n</em>+1)&times;(<em>n</em>+1) matrix $M$ described in Theorem 1 of Rababah (2003)[^52].</li>
<li>Multiply the matrix by the transposed coefficients $(c_0, ..., c_n)$ to get the polynomial&#39;s Bernstein coefficients $b_0, ..., b_n$.  (Transposing means turning columns to rows and vice versa.)</li>
<li>For each $i$, replace the Bernstein coefficient $b_i$ with $\text{floor}(b_i / (\epsilon/2) + 1/2) \cdot (\epsilon/2)$.</li>
<li>Return the Bernstein coefficients $b_0, ..., b_n$.</li>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The following statement can be shown.  Let $f(x)$ be continuous on the interval $[a, b]$.  If the $r$-th derivative of $f$, call it $FR$, has total variation $V$, where $r\ge 1$, then $g(x) = FR(a+(b-a) (x+1)/2)$ has total variation $V\left(\frac{b-a}{2}\right)^r$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$.</li>
<li>The method in this section doesn&#39;t require $f(\lambda)$ to have a particular minimum or maximum.  In the approximate Bernoulli factory setting, the following changes to the method are needed:

<ul>
<li>$f(\lambda)$ must be continuous on the closed unit interval ($a=0$, $b=1$) and take on only values in that interval.</li>
<li>If any Bernstein coefficient returned by the method is less than 0 or greater than 1, double the value of $n$ and repeat the method starting at step 2 until that condition is no longer true.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It would be of interest to build Chebyshev-like interpolants that sample $f(\lambda)$ at rational values of $\lambda$ that get closer to the Chebyshev points (e.g., $cos(j\pi/n)$) with increasing $n$, and to find results that provide explicit bounds (with no hidden constants) on the approximation error that are close to those for Chebyshev interpolants.</li>

<li><em>&omega;</em> is assumed to be nonnegative because absolute values are nonnegative.

To prove the third bound: abs(<strong>E</strong>[<em>f</em>(<em>X</em>/<em>n</em>)] &minus; <em>f</em>(<em>k</em>/(2 * <em>n</em>))) &le; <em>&omega;</em>(sqrt(<strong>Var</strong>[<em>X</em>/<em>n</em>])) &le; <em>&omega;</em>(sqrt(1/(2*n))).

<li>By the definition of Hölder continuous functions, take <em>&omega;</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>M</em>*<em>x</em><sup><em>&alpha;</em></sup>.  Because <em>&omega;</em> is a concave modulus of continuity on the closed unit interval, the result follows from part 1.</li>
<li>(Much of this proof builds on Nacu and Peres 2005, Proposition 6(ii)[^1].) The expected value (see note 1) of $X$ is $E[X/n]=k/(2n)$. Since $E[X/n-k/(2n)] = 0$, it follows that $f&#39;(X/n) E(X/n-k/(2n)) = 0$.  Moreover, $|f(x)-f(s)-f&#39;(x)(x-s)|\le (M/2)(x-s)^2$ (see Micchelli 1973, Theorem 3.2)[^12], so&mdash; $$E[|f(X/n)-f(k/(2n))|]=|E[f(X/n)-f(k/(2n))-f&#39;(k/(2n))(X/n-k/(2n))]|$$ $$\le (M/2)(X/n-k/(2n))^2 \le (M/2) Var(X/n).$$  By part 1&#39;s proof, it follows that (<em>M</em>/2)*<strong>Var</strong>[<em>X</em>/<em>n</em>] = (<em>M</em>/2)*(<em>k</em>*(2 * <em>n</em>&minus;<em>k</em>)/(4*(2 * <em>n</em>&minus;1)*<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>)) &le; (<em>M</em>/2)*(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>/(4*(2 * <em>n</em>&minus;1)*<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>)) = (<em>M</em>/2)*(1/(8*<em>n</em>&minus;4)) = <em>&rho;</em>.  For every integer <em>n</em>&ge;4 that&#39;s a power of 2, <em>&rho;</em> &le;  (<em>M</em>/2)*(1/(7*<em>n</em>)).</li>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Strukov and Timan (1977)[^57] proved the following bound: $$\
|\mathbb{E}[f(Y)]-f(\mathbb{E}[Y])|\le C\omega_2((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2),$$ where <em>Y</em> is a random variable and &omega;<sub>2</sub>(.) is a <em>second-order modulus of continuity</em> of <em>f</em> (see note below), and where $C$ is 3 if $Y$ takes on any value in the real line, or 15 if $Y$ takes on only values greater than one real number and less than another, as in this case.</p>

<p>Suppose <em>Y</em> = <em>X</em>/<em>n</em>, where <em>X</em> is as in Lemma 2.  Then <em>Y</em>&#39;s variance (<strong>Var</strong>[<em>Y</em>]) is less than or equal to 1/(8*<em>n</em>&minus; 4), and the left-hand side of Strukov and Timan&#39;s bound is the same as the expression (1).</p>

<p>Case 1: Since $f$ is Hölder continuous, there is an ordinary modulus of continuity $\omega$ for it such that $\omega(h)\le Lh^\alpha$. Therefore, applying Strukov and Timan&#39;s bound, the bound on <em>Y</em>&#39;s variance, as well as a property given in Stancu et al. (2001)[^48] leads to&mdash; $$\text{abs}(\mathbb{E}[f(Y)]-f(\mathbb{E}[Y]))\le C\omega_2((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)$$ $$\le 2C\omega((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)\le 2CL((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)^\alpha)\le 2CL \frac{(1/(8n-4))^{\alpha/2}}{2^\alpha}.$$</p>

<p>Case 2: Since $f$&#39;s derivative is Hölder continuous, there is an ordinary modulus of continuity $\omega$ for it such that $\omega(h)\le Lh^\alpha$. Thus, by the proof of Case 1 as well as a property given in Stancu et al. (2001)[^48]&mdash; $$C\omega_2((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)\le C ((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2) \omega((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)\le CL((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)^{1+\alpha}$$ $$\le CL(\sqrt{1/(8n-4)}/2)^{1+\alpha}.$$</p>

<p>Case 3: Follows from case 2 since a Hölder continuous function with Hölder exponent 1 and Hölder constant $L$ is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $M$.</p>

<p>Case 4: Since <em>f</em> is in the Zygmund class, there is an $\omega_2$ for it such that $\omega_{2}(h)\le D h$.  Thus, by the proof of Case 1&mdash; $$C\omega_2((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2)\le CD ((\text{Var}[Y])^{1/2}/2) = CD\sqrt{1/(8n-4)}/2.$$ &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> <em>Let $f$ be a strictly bounded factory function, let $n_0\ge 1$ be an integer, and let $\phi(n)$ be a function that takes on a nonnegative value.

<p>$$\eta(n)=\sum_{k\ge \log_2(n)} \phi(2^k),$$</p>

<p><em>for every integer n&ge;1 that&#39;s a power of 2.  If the series &eta;(n) converges to a finite value for each such $n$, and if it converges to 0 as $n$ gets large, then the following scheme for f(&lambda;) is valid in the following sense:</em></p>

<p><em>There are polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ (where $n\ge 1$ is an integer power of 2) as follows. The $k$-th Bernstein coefficient of $g_n$ and $h_n$ is <strong>fbelow</strong>(n, k) and <strong>fabove</strong>(n, k), respectively (where $0\le k\le n$), where:</em></p>

<p><em>If $n_0 = 1$:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>fbelow</strong>(n, k) =</em> $f(k/n)-\eta(n)$.</li>
<li><em><strong>fabove</strong>(n, k) =</em> $f(k/n)+\eta(n)$.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If $n_0 &gt; 1$:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>fbelow</strong>(n, k) =</em> min(<strong>fbelow</strong>($n_0$,0), <strong>fbelow</strong>($n_0$,1), ..., <strong>fbelow</strong>($n_0$,$n_0$)) <em>if</em> $n &lt; n_0$; $f(k/n)-\eta(n)$ <em>otherwise.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>fabove</strong>(n, k) =</em> max(<strong>fabove</strong>($n_0$,0), <strong>fabove</strong>($n_0$,1), ..., <strong>fbelow</strong>($n_0$,$n_0$)) <em>if</em> $n &lt; n_0$; $f(k/n)+\eta(n)$ <em>otherwise.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>The polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ satisfy:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>$g_n \le h_n$.</em></li>
<li><em>$g_n$ and $h_n$ converge to $f$ as $n$ gets large.</em></li>
<li>$(g_{n+1}-g_n)$ <em>and</em> $(h_{n}-h_{n+1})$ <em>are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once they are rewritten to polynomials in Bernstein form of degree exactly $n+1$.</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> For simplicity, this proof assumes first that $n_0 = 1$.</p>

<p>For the series <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) in the theorem, because $\phi(n)$ is nonnegative, each term of the series is nonnegative making the series nonnegative and, by the assumption that the series converges, <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) is nowhere increasing with increasing <em>n</em>.</p>

<p>Item 1 is trivial.  If $n\ge n_0$, $g_n$ is simply the Bernstein polynomial of $f$ minus a nonnegative value, and $h_n$ is the Bernstein polynomial of $f$ plus that same value, and if $n$ is less than $n_0$, $g_n$ is a constant value not less than the lowest point reachable by the lower polynomials, and $h_n$ is a constant value not less than the highest point reachable by the upper polynomials.</p>

<p>Item 2 is likewise trivial. A well known result is that the Bernstein polynomials of $f$ converge to $f$ as their degree $n$ gets large.  And because the series <em>&eta;</em> (in Theorem 1) sums to a finite value that goes to 0 as $n$ increases, the upper and lower shifts will converge to 0 so that $g_n$ and $h_n$ converge to the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomials and thus to $f$.</p>

<p>Item 3 is the <em>consistency requirement</em> described earlier in this page. This is ensured as in Proposition 10 of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] by bounding, from below, the offset by which to shift the approximating polynomials.  This lower bound is <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>), a solution to the equation 0 = <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) &minus; <em>&eta;</em>(2 * <em>n</em>) &minus; <em>&phi;</em>(<em>n</em>) (see note below), where <em>&phi;</em>(<em>n</em>) is a function that takes on a nonnegative value.</p>

<p><em>&phi;</em>(<em>n</em>) is, roughly speaking, the minimum distance between one polynomial and the next so that the consistency requirement is met between those two polynomials.  Compare the assumptions on <em>&phi;</em> in Theorem 1 with equations (10) and (11) in Nacu and Peres (2005).</p>

<p>The solution for $\eta(n)$ given in the statement of the theorem is easy to prove by noting that this is a recursive process: we start by calculating the series for <em>n</em> = 2*<em>n</em>, then adding <em>&phi;</em>(<em>n</em>) to it (which will be positive), in effect working backwards and recursively, and we can easily see that we can calculate the series for <em>n</em> = 2*<em>n</em> only if the series converges, hence the assumption of a converging series.</p>

<p>Now to prove the result assuming that $n_0 &gt; 1$.</p>

<p>Doing this involves taking advantage of the observation in Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] that we can start defining the polynomials at any $n$ greater than 0, including $n = n_0$; in that case, the upper and lower polynomials of degree 1 or greater, but less than $n_0$, would be constant functions, so that as polynomials in Bernstein form, the coefficients of each one would be equal. The lower constants are no greater than $g_{n_0}$&#39;s lowest Bernstein coefficient, and the upper constants are no less than $g_{n_0}$&#39;s highest Bernstein coefficients; they meet Item 3 because these lower and upper constants, when rewritten as polynomials in Bernstein form degree $n_0$, have Bernstein coefficients that are still no greater or no less, respectively, than the corresponding degree-$n_0$ polynomial. With the <em>&phi;</em> given in this theorem, the series <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) in the theorem remains nonnegative.  Moreover, since <em>&eta;</em> is assumed to converge, <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) still decreases with increasing <em>n</em>. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1A.</strong> <em>If a scheme satisfies Theorem 1, the polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ in the scheme can be made to satisfy conditions (i), (iii), and (iv) of Proposition 3 of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] as follows:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>$g_n$ = $g_{n-1}$ <em>and</em> $h_n$ = $h_{n-1}$ <em>whenever $n$ is an integer greater than 1 and not a power of 2.</em></li>
<li><em>If <strong>fabove</strong>(n, k) &gt; 1 for a given $n$ and some $k$, the coefficients of $h_n$ (the upper polynomial) are all 1.</em></li>
<li><em>If <strong>fbelow</strong>(n, k) &lt; 0 for a given $n$ and some $k$, the coefficients of $g_n$ (the lower polynomial) are all 0.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Condition (i) of Proposition 3 says that each coefficient of the polynomials must be 0 or greater and 1 or less.  This is ensured starting with a large enough value of <em>n</em> greater than 0 that&#39;s a power of 2, call it <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, as shown next.</p>

<p>Let <em>&epsilon;</em> be a positive distance between 0 and the minimum or between 1 and the maximum of <em>f</em>, whichever is smaller.  This <em>&epsilon;</em> exists by the assumption that <em>f</em> is bounded away from 0 and 1. Because the series <em>&eta;</em> (in Theorem 1) sums to a finite value that goes to 0 as $n$ increases, <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) will eventually stay less than <em>&epsilon;</em>.  And if $n\ge n_0$ is a power of 2 (where $n_0$ is as in Theorem 1), the <code>f(k/n)</code> term is bounded by the minimum and maximum of <em>f</em> by construction. This combined means that the lower and upper polynomials&#39; Bernstein coefficients will eventually be bounded by 0 and 1 for every integer <em>n</em> starting with <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>For <em>n</em> less than <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, condition (i) is ensured by setting the lower or upper polynomial&#39;s coefficient to 0 or 1, respectively, whenever a coefficient of the degree-<em>n</em> polynomial would otherwise be less than 0 or greater than 1, respectively.</p>

<p>Condition (iii) of Proposition 3 is mostly ensured by item 2 of Theorem 1.  The only thing to add is that for $n$ less than <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, the lower and upper polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ can be treated as 0 or 1 without affecting convergence, and that for $n$ other than a power of 2, defining $g_n = g_{n-1}$ and $h_n = h_{n-1}$ maintains condition (iii) by Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1].</p>

<p>Condition (iv) of Proposition 3 is mostly ensured by item 3 of Theorem 1.  For <em>n</em>=<em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, condition (iv) is maintained by noting that the degree-<em>n</em><sub>1</sub> polynomial&#39;s coefficients must be bounded by 0 and 1 by condition (i) so they will likewise be bounded by those of the lower and upper polynomials of degree less than <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, and those polynomials are the constant 0 and the constant 1, respectively, as are their coefficients. Finally, for $n$ other than a power of 2, defining $g_n = g_{n-1}$ and $h_n = h_{n-1}$ maintains condition (iv) by Remark B of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1].  &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The last condition of Proposition 3, condition (ii), says <strong>fabove</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>)*choose(<em>n</em>,<em>k</em>) and <strong>fbelow</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>)*choose(<em>n</em>,<em>k</em>) must be integers.  But Proposition 3 assumes only the biased coin and no other randomness is used, and that the coin doesn&#39;t show heads every time or tails every time.  Therefore, <em>f</em>(0), if it exists, must be an integer, and the same is true for <em>f</em>(1), so that condition (ii) is redundant with condition (iii) due to a result that goes back to Kantorovich (1931)[^58]; see also Remark C of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1].</p>

</ul>

<p><em>Where &eta;(n) = M*(2/7)<sup>&alpha;/2</sup>/((2<sup>&alpha;/2</sup>&minus;1)*n<sup>&alpha;/2</sup>).</em></p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Because $f$ is Hölder continuous, it admits the modulus of continuity $\omega(x)=Mx^{\alpha}$.  By part 1 of lemma 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2 ($n_0=1$ in Theorem 1), $\phi(n)=\omega(\sqrt{1/(2n)})=M (1/(2n))^{\alpha/2}$ can be taken for each such integer $n$, and thus $\eta(n)=D(n)=\frac{M}{((2^{\alpha/2}-1) n^{\alpha/2}}$ (where $\eta(n)$ is as in Theorem 1).</li>
<li>For each integer $n\ge 4$ that&#39;s a power of 2 ($n_0=4$ in Theorem 1), $\phi(n)=\omega(\sqrt{1/(2n)})=M (1/(7n))^{\alpha/2}$ can be taken for each such integer $n$, and thus $\eta(n)=$ M*(2/7)<sup>&alpha;/2</sup>/((2<sup>&alpha;/2</sup>&minus;1)*n<sup>&alpha;/2</sup>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases $\eta(n)$ is finite and converges to 0 as $n$ increases.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 2.</strong> <em>Let f(&lambda;) be a strictly bounded factory function.  If that function is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant M, then the following scheme determined by <strong>fbelow</strong> and <strong>fabove</strong> is valid in the sense of Theorem 1:</em></p>

<p><em>Proof.</em>  Follows from Theorem 1 and part 4 of Lemma 2 above. With the <em>&phi;</em> given in this theorem, the series <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) in Theorem 1 remains nonnegative; also, this theorem adopts Theorem 1&#39;s assumption that the series converges, so that <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>) still decreases with increasing <em>n</em>. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>The following lemma shows that if a scheme for $f(\lambda)$ shifts polynomials upward and downward, the pre-shifted polynomials are close to $f(\lambda)$ by the amount of the shift.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 3.</strong> <em>Let $f$ be a strictly bounded factory function. Let $S$ be an infinite set of positive integers.  For each integer $n\ge 1$, let $W_n(\lambda)$ be a function, and let $\epsilon_n(f)$ be a nonnegative constant that depends on $f$ and $n$.  Suppose that there are polynomials $g_n$ and $h_n$ (for each $n$ in $S$) as follows:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>$g_n$ and $h_n$ have Bernstein coefficients $W_n(k/n) - \epsilon_n(f)$ and $W_n(k/n) + \epsilon_n(f)$, respectively ($0\le k\le n$).</em></li>
<li><em>$g_n \le h_n$.</em></li>
<li><em>$g_n$ and $h_n$ converge to $f$ as $n$ gets large.</em></li>
<li>$(g_{m}-g_n)$ <em>and</em> $(h_{n}-h_{m})$ <em>are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once they are rewritten to polynomials in Bernstein form of degree exactly $m$, where $m$ is the smallest number greater than $n$ in $S$.</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Then for each $n$ in $S$, $|f(\lambda) - B_n(W_n(\lambda))| \le \epsilon_n(f)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, where $B_n(W_n(\lambda))$ is the Bernstein polynomial of degree $n$ of the function $W_n(\lambda)$.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> $W_n(k/n)$ is the $k$-th Bernstein coefficient of $B_n(W_n(\lambda))$, which is $g_n$ and $h_n$ before they are shifted downward and upward, respectively, by $\epsilon_n(f)$.  Moreover, property 4 in the lemma corresponds to condition (iv) of Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1], which implies that, for every $m&gt;n$, $g_{n}(\lambda)\le g_{m}(\lambda)\le f(\lambda)$ (the lower polynomials &quot;increase&quot;) and $h_{n}(\lambda)\ge h_{m}(\lambda)\ge f(\lambda)$ (the upper polynomials &quot;decrease&quot;) for every $n\ge 1$ (Nacu and Peres 2005, Remark A)[^1].</p>

<p>Then if $B_n(W_n(\lambda)) &lt; f(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda$ in the closed unit interval, shifting the left-hand side upward by $\epsilon_n(f)$ (a nonnegative constant) means that $h_n = B_n(W_n(\lambda))+\epsilon_n(f) \ge f(\lambda)$, and rearranging this expression leads to $f(\lambda) - B_n(W_n(\lambda)) \le \epsilon_n(f)$.</p>

<p>Likewise, if $B_n(W_n(\lambda)) &gt; f(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda$ in the closed unit interval, shifting the left-hand side downward by $\epsilon_n(f)$ means that $g_n = B_n(W_n(\lambda))-\epsilon_n(f) \le f(\lambda)$, and rearranging this expression leads to $B_n(W_n(\lambda)) - f(\lambda) \le \epsilon_n(f)$.</p>

<p>This combined means that $|f(x) - B_n(W_n(\lambda))| \le \epsilon_n(f)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$.  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 4</strong>.  <em>If $f(\lambda)$ satisfies a scheme given in Theorem 1 with $n_0\ge 1$, then $B_n(f(\lambda))$ comes within $\eta(n)$ of $f$ for every integer $n\ge n_0$ that&#39;s a power of 2; that is, $|B_n(f(\lambda))| \le \eta(n)$ for every such $n$.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lemma 5</strong>. Let $n\ge 1$ be an integer.  Suppose $g_{2n}$ and $g_{n}$ are polynomials in Bernstein form of degree $2n$ and $n$, respectively, and their domain is the closed unit interval. Suppose $g_{2n}$ and $g_n$ satisfy the property:</p>

<ul>
<li>$(g_{2n}-g_n)$ is a polynomial with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once it is rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then for every $x\ge 0$, $g_{2n}+x$ and $g_n$ satisfy that property, and for every $x\ge 1$, $g_{2n}\cdot x$ and $g_n$ do as well.</p>

<p>The proof follows from two well-known properties of polynomials in Bernstein form: adding $x$ to $g_{2n}$ amounts to adding $x$ to its Bernstein coefficients, and multiplying $g_{2n}$ by $x$ amounts to multiplying its Bernstein coefficients by $x$.  In either case, $g_{2n}$&#39;s Bernstein coefficients become no less than they otherwise would, so that $(g_{2n}-g_n)$ continues to have non-negative Bernstein coefficients as required by the property.</p>

<p>It is also true that, for every $x\ge 0$, $g_{2n}\cdot x$ and $g_n\cdot x$ satisfy the same property, but a detailed proof of this is left as an exercise to anyone interested. (If $x=0$, $g_n\cdot x=g_{2n}\cdot x=0$, so that the property is trivially satisfied.)</p>

<p>Finally, it is true that, for every real number $x$, $g_{2n}+x$ and $g_n+x$ satisfy the same property, but, again, a detailed proof of this is left as an exercise to anyone interested. (If $x=0$, $g_n+x=g_n$ and $g_{2n}+x=g_{2n}$, so that the property is trivially satisfied.)</p>

<p><a id=A_Conjecture_on_Polynomial_Approximation></a></p>

<h4>A Conjecture on Polynomial Approximation</h4>

<p>The following conjecture suggests there may be a way to easily adapt other approximating polynomials, besides the ordinary Bernstein polynomials, to the Bernoulli factory problem.</p>

<p><strong>Conjecture.</strong></p>

<p>Let $r\ge 1$, and let $f$ be a strictly bounded factory function whose $r$-th derivative is continuous.  Let $M$ be the maximum of the absolute value of $f$ and its derivatives up to the $r$-th derivative. Let $W_{2^0}(\lambda), W_{2^1}(\lambda), ..., W_{2^n}(\lambda),...$ be functions on the closed unit interval that converge uniformly to $f$ (that is, for every tolerance level, all $W_{2^i}$ after some value $i$ are within that tolerance level of $f$ at all points on the closed unit interval).</p>

<p>For each integer $n\ge1$ that&#39;s a power of 2, suppose that there is $D&gt;0$ such that&mdash; $$|f(\lambda)-B_n(W_n(\lambda))| \le DM/n^{r/2},$$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, where $B_n(W_n(\lambda))$ is the degree-$n$ Bernstein polynomial of $W_n(\lambda)$.</p>

<p>Then there is $C_0\ge D$ such that for every $C\ge C_0$, there are polynomials $g_n$ (for each $n\ge 1$) as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>$g_n$ has Bernstein coefficients $W_n(k/n) - CM/n^{r/2}$ ($0\le k\le n$), if $n$ is a power of 2, and $g_n=g_{n-1}$ otherwise.</li>
<li>$g_n$ converges to $f$ as $n$ gets large.</li>
<li>$(g_{n+1}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients once it is rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $n+1$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Equivalently (see also Nacu and Peres 2005), there is $C_1&gt;0$ such that, for each integer $n\ge 1$ that&#39;s a power of 2&mdash; $$\left|\left(\sum_{i=0}^k W_n\left(\frac{i}{n}\right) \sigma_{n,k,i}\right)-W_{2n}\left(\frac{k}{2n}\right)\right|\le \frac{C_1 M}{n^{r/2}},\tag{PB}$$ whenever $0\le k\le 2n$, so that $C=\frac{C_1}{1-\sqrt{2/2^{r+1}}}$.  Here, $\sigma_{n,k,i} = {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n \choose k}$ is the probability that a hypergeometric(2*<em>n</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>n</em>) random variable equals <em>i</em>.</p>

<p>It is further conjectured that the same value of $C_0$ (or $C_1$) suffices when $f$ has a Lipschitz continuous $(r-1)$-th derivative and $M$ is the maximum of the absolute value of $f$ and the Lipschitz constants of $f$ and its derivatives up to the $(r-1)$-th derivative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If $W_n(0)=f(0)$ and $W_n(1)=f(1)$ for every $n$, then (PB) is automatically true when $k=0$ and $k=2n$, so that the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\lt 2n$.  If, in addition, $W_n$ is symmetric about 1/2, so that $W_n(\lambda)=W_n(1-\lambda)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$, then the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\le n$ (since the values $\sigma_{n,k,i}$ are symmetric in that they satisfy $\sigma_{n,k,i}=\sigma_{n,k,k-i}$).</li>
<li>The left-hand side of (PB) is not greater than $|(\sum_{i=0}^k (W_n(\frac{i}{n}))\sigma_{n,k,i})-W_{n}(k/(2n))|$ + $|W_n(k/(2n))-f(k/(2n))|$  + $|W_{2n}(k/(2n))-f(k/(2n))|$.</li>
<li>By Lemma 3, $B_n(W_n(f(\lambda)))$ would be close to $f(\lambda)$ by at most $C_0 M/n^{r/2}$.  Properties 2 and 3 above correspond to (iii) and (iv) in Nacu and Peres (2005, Proposition 3)[^1].</li>
</ol>

<p>The following lower bounds on $C_0$, given certain polynomials, can be shown.  In the table:</p>

<ul>
<li>$M_{r}$ is the maximum of the absolute value of $f(\lambda)$ and its derivatives up to the $r$-th derivative.</li>

<h4>Example of Polynomial-Building Scheme</h4>

<p>The following example uses the results above to build a polynomial-building scheme for a factory function.</p>

<p>Let <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = 0 if <em>&lambda;</em> is 0, and (ln(<em>&lambda;</em>/exp(3)))<sup>&minus;2</sup> otherwise. (This function is not Hölder continuous; its slope is exponentially steep at the point 0.)  Then the following scheme is valid in the sense of Theorem 1:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&eta;</em>(<em>k</em>) = &Phi;(1, 2, (ln(<em>k</em>)+ln(7)+6)/ln(2))*4/ln(2)<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li><strong>fbelow</strong>(n, k) = f(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>).</li>
<li><strong>fabove</strong>(n, k) = max(<strong>fabove</strong>(4,0), <strong>fabove</strong>(4,1), ..., <strong>fabove</strong>(4,4)) if n &lt; 4; otherwise, f(<em>k</em>/<em>n</em>) +  <em>&eta;</em>(<em>n</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Where &Phi;(.) is a function called the <em>Lerch transcendent</em>.</p>

<p>The first step is to find a concave modulus of continuity of <em>f</em> (called <em>&omega;</em>(<em>h</em>)).  Because <em>f</em> is strictly increasing and concave, and because <em>f</em>(0) = 0, <em>&omega;</em>(<em>h</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>h</em>) can be taken for <em>&omega;</em>.</p>

<p>Now, plugging sqrt(1/(7*<em>n</em>)) into <em>&omega;</em> leads to the following for Theorem 2 (assuming <em>n</em>&ge;0):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&phi;</em>(<em>n</em>) = 1/(ln(sqrt(7/<em>n</em>)/7)&minus;3)<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, by applying Theorem 1, compute <em>&eta;</em>(<em>k</em>) by substituting <em>n</em> with 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, summing over [<em>k</em>, &infin;), and substituting <em>k</em> with ln(<em>k</em>)/ln(2).  <em>&eta;</em> converges, resulting in:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&eta;</em>(<em>k</em>) = &Phi;(1, 2, (ln(<em>k</em>)+ln(7)+6)/ln(2))*4/ln(2)<sup>2</sup>,</li>
</ul>

<p>where &Phi;(.) is the Lerch transcendent.  This <em>&eta;</em> matches the <em>&eta;</em> given in the scheme above.  That scheme then follows from Theorems 1 and 2, as well as from part 1 of Proposition 1 because <em>f</em> is concave.</p>

<p>the following code in Python that uses the SymPy computer algebra library is an example of finding the parameters for this polynomial-building scheme.</p>

<pre>px=Piecewise((0,Eq(x,0)),((ln(x/exp(3))**-2),True))
# omega is modulus of continuity.  Since
# px is strictly increasing, concave, and px(0)=0,
# take omega as px
omega=px
omega=piecewise_fold(omega.rewrite(Piecewise)).simplify()
# compute omega
phi=omega.subs(x,sqrt(1/(7*n)))
pprint(phi)
# compute eta
eta=summation(phi.subs(n,2**n),(n,k,oo)).simplify()
eta=eta.subs(k,log(k,2)) # Replace k with ln(k)/ln(2)
pprint(eta)
for i in range(20):
  # Calculate upper bounds for eta at certain points.
  try:
    print(&quot;eta(2^%d) ~= %s&quot; % (i,ceiling(eta.subs(k,2**i)*10000000).n()/10000000))
  except:
    print(&quot;eta(2^%d) ~= [FAILED]&quot; % (i))
</pre>

<h3>Which functions don&#39;t require outside randomness to simulate?</h3>

<p>The function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is <em>strongly simulable</em> if it admits a Bernoulli factory algorithm that uses nothing but the input coin as a source of randomness (Keane and O&#39;Brien 1994)[^53].  See &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Randomized_vs_Non_Randomized_Algorithms"><strong>Randomized vs. Non-Randomized Algorithms</strong></a>&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Simulability Statement.</strong> A function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) is strongly simulable only if&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><em>f</em> is constant on its domain, or is continuous and polynomially bounded on its domain, and</li>
<li><em>f</em> maps the closed unit interval or a subset of it to the closed unit interval, and</li>
<li><em>f</em>(0) equals 0 or 1 whenever 0 is in the domain of <em>f</em>, and</li>
<li><em>f</em>(1) equals 0 or 1 whenever 1 is in the domain of <em>f</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keane and O&#39;Brien already showed that <em>f</em> is strongly simulable if conditions 1 and 2 are true and neither 0 nor 1 are included in the domain of <em>f</em>.  Conditions 3 and 4 are required because <em>&lambda;</em> (the probability of heads) can be 0 or 1 so that the input coin returns 0 or 1, respectively, every time.  This is called a &quot;degenerate&quot; coin.  When given just a degenerate coin, no algorithm can produce one value with probability greater than 0, and another value with the opposite probability.  Rather, the algorithm can only produce a constant value with probability 1.  In the Bernoulli factory problem, that constant is either 0 or 1, so a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>f</em> must return 1 with probability 1, or 0 with probability 1, when given just a degenerate coin and no outside randomness, resulting in conditions 3 and 4.</p>

<p>To show that <em>f</em> is strongly simulable, it&#39;s enough to show that there is a Bernoulli factory for <em>f</em> that must flip the input coin and get 0 and 1 before it uses any outside randomness.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and is a polynomial with computable coefficients, it is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> If <em>f</em> is the constant 0 or 1, the proof is trivial: simply return 0 or 1, respectively.</p>

<p>Otherwise: Let <em>a</em>[<em>j</em>] be the <em>j</em><sup>th</sup> coefficient of the polynomial in Bernstein form.  Consider the following algorithm, modified from (Goyal and Sigman 2012)[^8].</p>

<ol>
<li>Flip the input coin <em>n</em> times, and let <em>j</em> be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way.</li>
<li>If 0 is in the domain of <em>f</em> and if <em>j</em> is 0, return <em>f</em>(0). (By condition 3, <em>f</em>(0) must be either 0 or 1.)</li>
<li>If 1 is in the domain of <em>f</em> and if <em>j</em> is <em>n</em>, return <em>f</em>(1). (By condition 4, <em>f</em>(1) must be either 0 or 1.)</li>
<li>With probability <em>a</em>[<em>j</em>], return 1.  Otherwise, return 0. (For example, generate a uniformly distributed random variate, greater than 0 and less than 1, then return 1 if that variate is less than <em>a</em>[<em>j</em>], or 0 otherwise.  <em>a</em>[<em>j</em>] is the coefficient <em>j</em> of the polynomial written in Bernstein form), or 0 otherwise.</li>

<p>(By the properties of the Bernstein form, <em>a</em>[0] will equal <em>f</em>(0) and <em>a</em>[<em>n</em>] will equal <em>f</em>(1) whenever 0 or 1 is in the domain of <em>f</em>, respectively.)</p>

<p>Step 4 is done by first generating unbiased bits (such as with the von Neumann trick of flipping the input coin twice until the flip returns 0 then 1 or 1 then 0 this way, then taking the result as 0 or 1, respectively (von Neumann 1951)[^59]), then using the algorithm in &quot;<a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Digit_Expansion"><strong>Digit Expansions</strong></a>&quot; to produce the probability <em>a</em>[<em>j</em>].  The algorithm computes <em>a</em>[<em>j</em>] bit by bit and compares the computed value with the generated bits.  Since the coin returned both 0 and 1 in step 1 earlier in the algorithm, we know the coin isn&#39;t degenerate, so that step 4 will finish with probability 1.  Now, since the Bernoulli factory used only the input coin for randomness, this shows that <em>f</em> is strongly simulable. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 2.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement, and if either f is constant on its domain or f meets the additional conditions below, then f is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 0 or both, then there is a polynomial g(&lambda;) in Bernstein form whose coefficients are computable and in the closed unit interval, such that g(0) = f(0) and g(1) = f(1) whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that g(&lambda;) &gt; f(&lambda;) for every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1.</em></li>
<li><em>If f(0) = 1 or f(1) = 1 or both, then there is a polynomial h(&lambda;) in Bernstein form whose coefficients are computable and in the closed unit interval, such that h(0) = f(0) and h(1) = f(1) whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that h(&lambda;) &lt; f(&lambda;) for every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1.</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and meets the additional condition below, then f is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>There is a polynomial g(&lambda;) in Bernstein form whose coefficients are computable and in the closed unit interval, such that g(0) = f(0) and g(1) = f(1) whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, and such that g(&lambda;) &gt; f(&lambda;) for every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Proof:</em>  Consider the following algorithm.</p>

<ol>
<li>If <em>f</em> is 0 everywhere in its domain or 1 everywhere in its domain, return 0 or 1, respectively.</li>
<li><p>Otherwise, use the algorithm given in Proposition 1 to simulate <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).  If the algorithm returns 0, return 0. By the additional condition in the lemma, 0 will be returned if <em>&lambda;</em> is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Now, we know that the input coin&#39;s probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1.</p>

<p>By the conditions in the lemma, both <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)&gt;0 and <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)&gt;0 whenever 0 &lt; <em>&lambda;</em> &lt; 1 and <em>&lambda;</em> is in <em>f</em>&#39;s domain.</p>

<p>Now let <em>h</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)/<em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).  By the conditions in the lemma, <em>h</em> will be positive everywhere in that interval.</p></li>
<li><p>Return 1 if <em>h</em> has the following property: <em>h</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = 0 whenever 0 &lt; <em>&lambda;</em> &lt; 1 and <em>&lambda;</em> is in <em>f</em>&#39;s domain.</p></li>
<li>Otherwise, we run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>h</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) that uses the input coin (and possibly outside randomness).  Since <em>h</em> is continuous and polynomially bounded and the input coin&#39;s probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1, <em>h</em> is strongly simulable; we can replace the outside randomness in the algorithm with unbiased random bits via the von Neumann trick.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, <em>f</em> admits an algorithm that uses nothing but the input coin as a source of randomness, and so is strongly simulable. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and meets the additional conditions below, then f is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>There are two polynomials g(&lambda;) and &omega;(&lambda;) in Bernstein form, such that both polynomials&#39; coefficients are computable and all in the closed unit interval.</em></li>
<li><em>g(0) = &omega;(0) = f(0) = 0 (so that 0 is in the domain of f).</em></li>
<li><em>g(1) = &omega;(1) = f(1) = 1 (so that 1 is in the domain of f).</em></li>
<li><em>For every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1, g(&lambda;) &gt; f(&lambda;).</em></li>
<li><em>For every &lambda; in the domain of f, except at 0 and 1, &omega;(&lambda;) &lt; f(&lambda;).</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof:</em> First, assume <em>g</em> and <em>&omega;</em> have the same degree.  If not, rewrite the the polynomial with lesser degree to a polynomial in Bernstein form with the same degree as the other polynomial.</p>

<p>Now, let <em>g</em>[<em>j</em>] and <em>&omega;</em>[<em>j</em>] be the <em>j</em><sup>th</sup> coefficient of the polynomial <em>g</em> or <em>&omega;</em>, respectively, in Bernstein form.  Consider the following algorithm, which is similar to the algorithm in Proposition 1.</p>

<ol>
<li>Flip the input coin <em>n</em> times, and let <em>j</em> be the number of times the coin returned 1 this way.</li>
<li>If 0 is in the domain of <em>f</em> and if <em>j</em> is 0, return <em>g</em>(0) = <em>&omega;</em>(0) = 0.</li>
<li>If 1 is in the domain of <em>f</em> and if <em>j</em> is <em>n</em>, return <em>g</em>(1) = <em>&omega;</em>(1) = 0.</li>
<li>Generate a uniformly distributed random variate, greater than 0 and less than 1, then return 1 if that variate is less than <em>&omega;</em>[<em>j</em>], or return 0 if that variate is greater than <em>g</em>[<em>j</em>].  This step is carried out via the von Neumann method, as in Proposition 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the algorithm didn&#39;t return a value, then by now we know that the input coin&#39;s probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1, since step 2 returned a value (either 0 or 1), which can only happen if the input coin didn&#39;t return all zeros or all ones.</p>

<p>Now let <em>r</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = (<em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) &minus; <em>&omega;</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)) / (<em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) &minus; <em>&omega;</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)).  By the conditions in the lemma, <em>h</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) will be positive wherever 0 &lt; <em>&lambda;</em> &lt; 1 and <em>&lambda;</em> is in the domain of <em>f</em>.</p>

<p>Now, run a Bernoulli factory algorithm for <em>r</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) that uses the input coin (and possibly outside randomness).  Since <em>r</em> is continuous and polynomially bounded and the input coin&#39;s probability of heads is neither 0 nor 1, <em>r</em> is strongly simulable; we can replace the outside randomness in the algorithm with unbiased random bits via the von Neumann trick.</p>

<p>Thus, <em>f</em> admits an algorithm that uses nothing but the input coin as a source of randomness, and so is strongly simulable. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><em>Proof of Proposition 2:</em>  The following cases can occur:</p>

<ol>
<li>If neither 0 nor 1 are in the domain of <em>f</em>, then <em>f</em> is strongly simulable by the discussion above.</li>
<li>If <em>f</em> is 0 everywhere in its domain or 1 everywhere in its domain: Return 0 or 1, respectively.</li>
<li>If 0 but not 1 is in the domain of <em>f</em>: If <em>f</em>(0) = 0, apply Lemma 1.  If <em>f</em>(0) = 1, apply Lemma 1, but take <em>f</em> = 1 &minus; <em>f</em> and return 1 minus the output of the lemma&#39;s algorithm (this will bring <em>f</em>(0) = 0 and satisfy the lemma.)</li>
<li>If 1 but not 0 is in the domain of <em>f</em>: If <em>f</em>(1) = 0, apply Lemma 1.  If <em>f</em>(1) = 1, apply Lemma 1, but take <em>f</em> = 1 &minus; <em>f</em> and return 1 minus the output of the lemma&#39;s algorithm (this will bring <em>f</em>(1) = 0 and satisfy the lemma.)</li>
<li><em>f</em>(0) = <em>f</em>(1) = 0: Apply Lemma 1.</li>
<li><em>f</em>(0) = <em>f</em>(1) = 1: Apply Lemma 1, but take <em>f</em> = 1 &minus; <em>f</em> and return 1 minus the output of the lemma&#39;s algorithm.</li>
<li><em>f</em>(0) = 0 and <em>f</em>(1) = 1: Apply Lemma 2.</li>
<li><em>f</em>(0) = 1 and <em>f</em>(1) = 0: Apply Lemma 2, but take <em>f</em> = 1 &minus; <em>f</em> and return 1 minus the output of the lemma&#39;s algorithm.</li>

<p><strong>Proposition 3.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement and is Lipschitz continuous, then f is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lemma 3.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement, is Lipschitz continuous, and is such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 0 whenever 0 or 1, respectively, is in the domain of f, then f is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> If <em>f</em> is 0 everywhere in its domain or 1 everywhere in its domain: Return 0 or 1, respectively.  Otherwise, let&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>M</em> be the Lipschitz constant of <em>f</em> (its derivative&#39;s maximum of the absolute value if <em>f</em> is continuous), or a computable number greater than this.</p></li>

<p>To build <em>g</em>, take its degree as ceil(<em>M</em>)+1 or greater (so that <em>g</em>&#39;s Lipschitz constant is greater than <em>M</em> and <em>g</em> has ceil(<em>M</em>) + 2 coefficients), then set the first coefficient as <em>l</em>, the last coefficient as <em>u</em>, and the remaining coefficients as 1. (As a result, the polynomial <em>g</em> will have computable coefficients.) Then <em>g</em> will meet the additional condition for Lemma 1 and the result follows from that lemma. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 4.</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is described in the strong simulability statement, is Lipschitz continuous, and is such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1 (so that 0 and 1 are in the domain of f), then f is strongly simulable.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Let <em>M</em> and <em>l</em> be as in Lemma 3.</p>

<p>To build <em>g</em> and <em>&omega;</em>, take their degree as ceil(<em>M</em>)+1 or greater (so that their Lipschitz constant is greater than <em>M</em> and each polynomial has ceil(<em>M</em>) + 2 coefficients), then for each polynomial, set its first coefficient as <em>l</em> and the last coefficient as 1. The remaining coefficients of <em>g</em> are set as 1 and the remaining coefficients of <em>&omega;</em> are set as 0.  (As a result, the polynomial <em>g</em> will have computable coefficients.)  Then <em>g</em> and <em>&omega;</em> will meet the additional conditions for Lemma 2 and the result follows from that lemma. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><em>Proof of Proposition 3:</em> In the proof of proposition 2, replace Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 with Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, respectively. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Conjecture 1</strong>. <em>The conditions of Proposition 2 are necessary for $f(\lambda)$ to be strongly simulable.</em></p>

<p>A condition such as &quot;0 is not in the domain of $f$, or there is a number $\epsilon&gt;0$ and a Lipschitz continuous function $g(x)$ on the interval $0\le x \lt \epsilon$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ whenever $x$ is in both $g$&#39;s and $f$&#39;s domains&quot; does not work.  An example that shows this is $f(x)=(\sin(1/x)/4+1/2)\cdot(1-(1-x)^n)$ for $n\ge 1$ (and $f(0)=0), which is strongly simulable at 0 even though the condition just quoted is not satisfied for $f$.  ($(1-x)^n$ is the probability of the biased coin showing zero $n$ times in a row.)</p>

<h3>Multiple-Output Bernoulli Factory</h3>

<p>A related topic is a Bernoulli factory that takes a coin with unknown probability of heads <em>&lambda;</em> and produces one or more samples of the probability <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).  This section calls it a <em>multiple-output Bernoulli factory</em>.</p>

<p>Obviously, any single-output Bernoulli factory can produce multiple outputs by running itself multiple times.  But for some functions <em>f</em>, it may be that producing multiple outputs at a time may use fewer input coin flips than producing one output multiple times.</p>

<p>Let <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> be real numbers satisfying 0 &lt; <em>a</em> &lt; <em>b</em> &lt; 1, such as <em>a</em>=1/100, <em>b</em>=99/100.  Define the <em>entropy bound</em> as <em>h</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>))/<em>h</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) where <em>h</em>(<em>x</em>) = &minus;<em>x</em>*ln(<em>x</em>)&minus;(1&minus;<em>x</em>)*ln(1&minus;<em>x</em>) is related to the Shannon entropy function.  The question is:</p>

<p><em>When the probability &lambda; is such that a &le; &lambda; &le; b, is there a multiple-output Bernoulli factory for f(&lambda;) with an expected (&quot;long-run average&quot;) number of input coin flips per sample that is arbitrarily close to the entropy bound?  Call such a Bernoulli factory an <strong>optimal factory</strong>.</em></p>

<p>(See Nacu and Peres (2005, Question 2)[^1].)</p>

<p>So far, the following functions do admit an <em>optimal factory</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The functions <em>&lambda;</em> and 1 &minus; <em>&lambda;</em>.</li>
<li>Constants <em>c</em> satisfying 0 &le; <em>c</em> &le; 1.  As Nacu and Peres (2005)[^1] already showed, any such constant admits an optimal factory: generate unbiased random bits using Peres&#39;s iterated von Neumann extractor (Peres 1992)[^60], then build a binary tree that generates 1 with probability <em>c</em> and 0 otherwise (Knuth and Yao 1976)[^61].</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to see that if an <em>optimal factory</em> exists for <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), then one also exists for 1 &minus; <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>): simply change all ones returned by the <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) factory into zeros and vice versa.</p>

<p>Also, as Yuval Peres (Jun. 24, 2021) told me, there is an efficient multiple-output Bernoulli factory for <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>&lambda;</em>/2: the key is to flip the input coin enough times to produce unbiased random bits using his extractor (Peres 1992)[^31], then multiply each unbiased bit with another input coin flip to get a sample from <em>&lambda;</em>/2.  Given that the sample is equal to 0, there are three possibilities that can &quot;be extracted to produce more fair bits&quot;: either the unbiased bit is 0, or the coin flip is 0, or both are 0.</p>

<p>This algorithm, though, doesn&#39;t count as an <em>optimal factory</em>, and Peres described this algorithm only incompletely.  By simulation and trial and error I found an improved version of the algorithm.  It uses two randomness extractors (extractor 1 and extractor 2) that produce unbiased random bits from biased data (which is done using a method given later in this section).  The extractors must be asymptotically optimal (they must approach the entropy limit as closely as desired); one example is the iterated von Neumann construction in Peres (1992)[^60].  The algorithm consists of doing the following in a loop until the desired number of outputs is generated.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the number of outputs generated so far is divisible by 20, do the following:

<ul>
<li>Generate an unbiased random bit (see below).  If that bit is zero, output 0, then repeat this step unless the desired number of outputs has been generated.  If the bit is 1, flip the input coin and output the result.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Otherwise, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Generate an unbiased random bit (see below), call it <em>fc</em>.  Then flip the input coin and call the result <em>bc</em>.</li>
<li>Output <em>fc</em>*<em>bc</em>.</li>
<li>(The following steps pass &quot;unused&quot; randomness to the extractor in a specific way to ensure correctness.) If <em>fc</em> is 0, and <em>bc</em> is 1, append 0 to extractor 2&#39;s input bits.</li>
<li>If <em>fc</em> and <em>bc</em> are both 0, append 1 then 1 to extractor 2&#39;s input bits.</li>
<li>If <em>fc</em> is 1 and <em>bc</em> is 0, append 1 then 0 to extractor 2&#39;s input bits.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Inspired by Peres&#39;s result with <em>&lambda;</em>/2, the following algorithm is proposed.  It works for every function writable as <em>D</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)/<em>E</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), where&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>$D$ is the polynomial $D(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^k \lambda^i (1-\lambda)^{k-i} d[i]$,</li>
<li>$E$ is the polynomial $E(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^k \lambda^i (1-\lambda)^{k-i} e[i]$,</li>
<li>every <em>d</em>[<em>i</em>] is less than or equal to the corresponding <em>e</em>[<em>i</em>], and</li>
<li>each <em>d</em>[<em>i</em>] and each <em>e</em>[<em>i</em>] is a nonnegative integer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm is a modified version of the &quot;block simulation&quot; in Mossel and Peres (2005, Proposition 2.5)[^62], which also &quot;extracts&quot; residual randomness with the help of six asymptotically optimal randomness extractors.  In the algorithm, let <em>r</em> be an integer such that, for every integer <em>i</em> in [0, <em>k</em>], <em>e</em>[<em>i</em>] &lt; choose(<em>k</em>, <em>i</em>)*choose(2*<em>r</em>, <em>r</em>).</p>

<ol>
<li>Set <em>iter</em> to 0.</li>
<li>Flip the input coin <em>k</em> times.  Then build a bitstring <em>B1</em> consisting of the coin flip results in the order they occurred.  Let <em>i</em> be the number of ones in <em>B1</em>.</li>
<li>Generate 2*<em>r</em> unbiased random bits (see below).  (Rather than flipping the input coin 2*<em>r</em> times, as in the algorithm of Proposition 2.5.)  Then build a bitstring <em>B2</em> consisting of the coin flip results in the order they occurred.</li>
<li>If the number of ones in <em>B2</em> is other than <em>r</em>: Translate <em>B1</em> + <em>B2</em> to an integer under mapping 1, then pass that number to extractor 2<sup>&dagger;</sup>, then add 1 to <em>iter</em>, then go to step 2.</li>
<li>Translate <em>B1</em> + <em>B2</em> to an integer under mapping 2, call the integer <em>&beta;</em>.  If <em>&beta;</em> &lt; <em>d</em>[<em>i</em>], pass <em>&beta;</em> to extractor 3, then pass <em>iter</em> to extractor 6, then output a 1.  Otherwise, if <em>&beta;</em> &lt; <em>e</em>[<em>i</em>], pass <em>&beta;</em> &minus; <em>d</em>[<em>i</em>] to extractor 4, then pass <em>iter</em> to extractor 6, then output a 0.  Otherwise, pass <em>&beta;</em> &minus; <em>e</em>[<em>i</em>] to extractor 5, then add 1 to <em>iter</em>, then go to step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>The mappings used in this algorithm are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>A one-to-one mapping between&mdash;

<ul>
<li>bitstrings of length <em>k</em> + 2*<em>r</em> with fewer or greater than <em>r</em> ones among the last 2*<em>r</em> bits, and</li>
<li>the integers in [0, 2<sup><em>k</em></sup> * (2<sup>2*<em>r</em></sup> &minus; choose(2*<em>r</em>, <em>r</em>))).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A one-to-one mapping between&mdash;

<ul>
<li>bitstrings of length <em>k</em> + 2*<em>r</em> with exactly <em>i</em> ones among the first <em>k</em> bits and exactly <em>r</em> ones among the remaining bits, and</li>
<li>the integers in [0, choose(<em>k</em>, <em>i</em>)*choose(2*<em>r</em>, <em>r</em>)).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In this algorithm, an unbiased random bit is generated as follows.  Let <em>m</em> be an even integer that is 32 or greater (in general, the greater <em>m</em> is, the more efficient the overall algorithm is in terms of coin flips).</p>

<ol>
<li>Use extractor 1 to extract outputs from floor(<em>n</em>/<em>m</em>)*<em>m</em> inputs, where <em>n</em> is the number of input bits available to that extractor.  Do the same for the remaining extractors.</li>
<li>If extractor 2 has at least one unused output bit, take an output and stop.  Otherwise, repeat this step for the remaining extractors.</li>
<li>Flip the input coin at least <em>m</em> times, append the coin results to extractor 1&#39;s inputs, and go to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now consider the last paragraph of Proposition 2.5.  If the input coin were flipped in step 2, the probability of&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>outputting 1 in the algorithm&#39;s last step would be <em>P1</em> = <em>&lambda;</em><sup><em>r</em></sup>*(1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>)<sup><em>r</em></sup>*<em>D</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).</li>
<li>outputting either 0 or 1 in that step would be <em>P01</em> = <em>&lambda;</em><sup><em>r</em></sup>*(1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>)<sup><em>r</em></sup>*<em>E</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>),</li>
</ul>

<p>so that the algorithm would simulate <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) = <em>P1</em> / <em>P01</em>.  Observe that the <em>&lambda;</em><sup><em>r</em></sup>*(1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>)<sup><em>r</em></sup> cancels out in the division.  Thus, we could replace the input coin with unbiased random bits and still simulate <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>); the <em>&lambda;</em><sup><em>r</em></sup>*(1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>)<sup><em>r</em></sup> above would then be (1/2)<sup>2*<em>r</em></sup>.</p>

<p>While this algorithm is coin-flip-efficient, it is not believed to be an optimal factory, at least not without more work.  In particular, a bigger savings of input coin flips could occur if <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) maps each value <em>a</em> or greater and <em>b</em> or less to a small range of values, so that the algorithm could, for example, generate a uniform random variate between 0 and 1 using unbiased random bits and see whether that variate lies outside that range of values &mdash; and thus produce a sample from <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) without flipping the input coin again.</p>

<p><small><sup>&dagger;</sup> For example, by translating the number to input bits via Pae&#39;s entropy-preserving binarization (Pae 2018)[^63].  But correctness might depend on how this is done; after all, the number of coin flips per sample must equal or exceed the entropy bound for every <em>&lambda;</em>.</small></p>

<h3>Pushdown Automata and Algebraic Functions</h3>

<p>This section has mathematical proofs showing which kinds of algebraic functions (functions that can be a solution of a nonzero polynomial equation) can be simulated with a pushdown automaton (a state machine with a stack).</p>

<p>The following summarizes what can be established about these algebraic functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>sqrt(<em>&lambda;</em>) can be simulated.</li>
<li>Every rational function with rational coefficients that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself can be simulated.</li>
<li>If <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) can be simulated, so can any Bernstein-form polynomial in the variable <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) with coefficients that can be simulated.</li>
<li>If <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) and <em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>) can be simulated, so can <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)*<em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), <em>f</em>(<em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)), and <em>g</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)).</li>
<li>If a full-domain pushdown automaton (defined later) can generate words of a given length with a given probability (a <em>probability distribution</em> of word lengths), then the probability generating function for that distribution can be simulated, as well as for that distribution conditioned on a finite set or periodic infinite set of word lengths (for example, all odd word lengths only).</li>
<li>If a stochastic context-free grammar (defined later) can generate a probability distribution of word lengths, and terminates with probability 1, then the probability generating function for that distribution can be simulated.</li>
<li>Every quadratic irrational number between 0 and 1 can be simulated.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not yet known whether the following functions can be simulated:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&lambda;</em><sup>1/<em>p</em></sup> for prime numbers <em>p</em> greater than 2. The answer may be no; Banderier and Drmota (2015)[^64] proved results that show, among other things, that $\lambda^{1/p}$, where $p$ is not a power of 2, is not a possible solution to $P(\lambda) = 0$, where $P(\lambda)$ is a polynomial whose coefficients are non-negative real numbers.</li>
<li>min(<em>&lambda;</em>, 1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The following definitions are used in this section:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <em>pushdown automaton</em> has a finite set of <em>states</em> and a finite set of <em>stack symbols</em>, one of which is called EMPTY, and takes a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability. It starts at a given state and its stack starts with EMPTY.  On each iteration:</p>

<ul>
<li>The automaton flips the coin.</li>
<li>Based on the coin flip (HEADS or TAILS), the current state, and the top stack symbol, it moves to a new state (or keeps it unchanged) and replaces the top stack symbol with zero, one or two symbols.  Thus, there are three kinds of <em>transition rules</em>:

<ul>
<li>(<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>symbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {<em>symbol2</em>}): move to <em>state2</em>, replace top stack symbol with same or different one.</li>
<li>(<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>symbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {<em>symbol2</em>, <em>new</em>}): move to <em>state2</em>, replace top stack symbol with <em>symbol2</em>, then <em>push</em> a new symbol (<em>new</em>) onto the stack.</li>
<li>(<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>symbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {}): move to <em>state2</em>, <em>pop</em> the top symbol from the stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Proposition 0</strong> (Mossel and Peres 2005[^65], Theorem 1.2): <em>A full-domain pushdown automaton can simulate a function that maps (0, 1) to itself only if the function is in class <strong>ALGRAT</strong>.</em></p>

<p>It is not known whether <strong>ALGRAT</strong> and <strong>PDA</strong> are equal, but the following can be established about <strong>PDA</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1A:</strong> <em>Let g(&lambda;) be a function in the class <strong>PDA</strong>, and suppose a pushdown automaton F has two rules of the form (<code>state</code>, HEADS, <code>stacksymbol</code>) &rarr; RHS1 and (<code>state</code>, TAILS, <code>stacksymbol</code>) &rarr; RHS2, where <code>state</code> and <code>stacksymbol</code> are a specific state/symbol pair among the left-hand sides of F&#39;s rules.  Then there is a pushdown automaton that transitions to RHS1 with probability g(&lambda;) and to RHS2 with probability 1&minus;g(&lambda;) instead.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> If RHS1 and RHS2 are the same, then the conclusion holds and nothing has to be done.  Thus assume RHS1 and RHS2 are different.</p>

<p>Let <em>G</em> be the full-domain pushdown automaton for <em>g</em>. Assume that machines <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> stop when they pop EMPTY from the stack. If this is not the case, transform both machines by renaming the symbol EMPTY to EMPTY&prime;&prime;, adding a new symbol EMPTY&prime;&prime; and new starting state X0, and adding rules (X0, <em>flip</em>, EMPTY) &rarr; (<em>start</em>, {EMPTY&prime;&prime;}) and rule (<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, EMPTY) &rarr; (<em>state</em>, {}) for all states other than X0, where <em>start</em> is the starting state of <em>F</em> or <em>G</em>, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Now, rename each state of <em>G</em> as necessary so that the sets of states of <em>F</em> and of <em>G</em> are disjoint (mutually exclusive).  Then, add to <em>F</em> a new stack symbol EMPTY&prime; (or a name not found in the stack symbols of G, as the case may be).  Then, for the following two pairs of rules in <em>F</em>, namely&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>state</em>, HEADS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2heads</em>, <em>stackheads</em>), and<br>
(<em>state</em>, TAILS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2tails</em>, <em>stacktails</em>),</p>

<p>add two new states <em>state</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>state</em><sub>1</sub> that correspond to <em>state</em> and have names different from all other states, and replace that rule with the following rules:</p>

<p>(<em>state</em>, HEADS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>gstart</em>, {<em>stacksymbol</em>, EMPTY&prime;}),<br>
(<em>state</em>, TAILS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>gstart</em>, {<em>stacksymbol</em>, EMPTY&prime;}),<br>
(<em>state</em><sub>0</sub>, HEADS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2heads</em>, <em>stackheads</em>),<br>
(<em>state</em><sub>0</sub>, TAILS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2heads</em>, <em>stackheads</em>),<br>
(<em>state</em><sub>1</sub>, HEADS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2tails</em>, <em>stacktails</em>), and<br>
(<em>state</em><sub>1</sub>, TAILS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (<em>state2tails</em>, <em>stacktails</em>),<br></p>

<p>where <em>gstart</em> is the starting state for <em>G</em>, and copy the rules of the automaton for <em>G</em> onto <em>F</em>, but with the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace the symbol EMPTY in <em>G</em> with EMPTY&prime;.</li>
<li>Replace each state in <em>G</em> with a name distinct from all other states in <em>F</em>.</li>
<li>Replace each rule in <em>G</em> of the form (<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {}), where <em>state2</em> is a final state of <em>G</em> associated with output 1, with the rule (<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; ( <em>state</em><sub>1</sub>, {}).</li>
<li>Replace each rule in <em>G</em> of the form (<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; (<em>state2</em>, {}), where <em>state2</em> is a final state of <em>G</em> associated with output 0, with the rule (<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, EMPTY&prime;) &rarr; ( <em>state</em><sub>0</sub>, {}).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, the final states of the new machine are the same as those for the original machine <em>F</em>. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1B:</strong>  <em>There are pushdown automata that simulate the probabilities 0 and 1.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> The probability 0 automaton has the rules (START, HEADS, EMPTY) &rarr; (START, {}) and (START, TAILS, EMPTY) &rarr; (START, {}), and its only state START is associated with output 0. The probability 1 automaton is the same, except START is associated with output 1.  Both automata obviously terminate with probability 1. &#x25a1;</p>

<p>Because of Lemma 1A, it&#39;s possible to label each left-hand side of a pushdown automaton&#39;s rules with not just HEADS or TAILS, but also a rational number or another function in <strong>PDA</strong>, as long as for each state/symbol pair, the probabilities for that pair sum to 1.  For example, rules like the following are now allowed:</p>

<p>(START, 1/2, EMPTY) &rarr; ..., (START, sqrt(<em>&lambda;</em>)/2, EMPTY) &rarr; ..., (START, (1 &minus; sqrt(<em>&lambda;</em>))/2, EMPTY) &rarr; ....</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1A:</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) is in the class <strong>PDA</strong>, then so is every polynomial written as&mdash;</em></p>

<p>$${n\choose 0}f(\lambda)^0 (1-f(\lambda))^{n-0} a[0] + {n\choose 1}f(\lambda)^1 (1-f(\lambda))^{n-1} a[1] + ... + {n\choose n}f(\lambda)^n (1-f(\lambda))^{n-n} a[n],$$</p>

<p><em>where n is the polynomial&#39;s degree and a[0], a[1], ..., a[n] are functions in the class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof Sketch</em>: This corresponds to a two-stage pushdown automaton that follows the algorithm of Goyal and Sigman (2012)[^8]: The first stage counts the number of &quot;heads&quot; shown when flipping the f(&lambda;) coin, and the second stage flips another coin that has success probability <em>a</em>[<em>i</em>], where <em>i</em> is the number of &quot;heads&quot;. The automaton&#39;s transitions take advantage of Lemma 1A.  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1:</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) and g(&lambda;) are functions in the class <strong>PDA</strong>, then so is their product, namely f(&lambda;)*g(&lambda;).</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Special case of Proposition 1A with <em>n</em>=1, <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)=<em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), <em>a</em>[0]=0 (using Lemma 1B), and <em>a</em>[1]=<em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 1A:</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;), g(&lambda;), and h(&lambda;) are functions in the class <strong>PDA</strong>, then so is f(&lambda;)*g(&lambda;) + (1&minus;f(&lambda;))*h(&lambda;).</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Special case of Proposition 1A with <em>n</em>=1, <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>)=<em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), <em>a</em>[0]=<em>h</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), and <em>a</em>[1]=<em>g</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 2:</strong> <em>If f(&lambda;) and g(&lambda;) are functions in the class <strong>PDA</strong>, then so is their composition, namely f(g(&lambda;)) or (f&#x2218;g)(&lambda;).</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Let <em>F</em> be the full-domain pushdown automaton for <em>f</em>. For each state/symbol pair among the left-hand sides of <em>F</em>&#39;s rules, apply Lemma 1A to the automaton <em>F</em>, using the function <em>g</em>.  Then the new machine <em>F</em> terminates with probability 1 because the original <em>F</em> and the original automaton for <em>g</em> do for every <em>&lambda;</em> greater than 0 and less than 1, and because the automaton for <em>g</em> never outputs the same value with probability 0 or 1 for any <em>&lambda;</em> greater than 0 or less than 1.  Moreover, <em>f</em> is in class <strong>PDA</strong> by Theorem 1.2 of (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^65] because the machine is a full-domain pushdown automaton.  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 3:</strong> <em>Every rational function with rational coefficients that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself is in class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> These functions can be simulated by a finite-state machine (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^65].  This corresponds to a full-domain pushdown automaton that has no stack symbols other than EMPTY, never pushes symbols onto the stack, and pops the only symbol EMPTY from the stack whenever it transitions to a final state of the finite-state machine. &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An unbounded stack size is necessary for a pushdown automaton to simulate functions that a finite-state machine can&#39;t.  With a bounded stack size, there is a finite-state machine where each state not only holds the pushdown automaton&#39;s original state, but also encodes the contents of the stack (which is possible because the stack&#39;s size is bounded); each operation that would push, pop, or change the top symbol transitions to a state with the appropriate encoding of the stack instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proposition 4:</strong> <em>If a full-domain pushdown automaton can generate words with the same letter such that the length of each word follows a probability distribution, then that distribution&#39;s probability generating function is in class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Let <em>F</em> be a full-domain pushdown automaton.  Add one state FAILURE, then augment <em>F</em> with a special &quot;letter-generating&quot; operation as follows.  Add the following rule that pops all symbols from the stack:</p>

<p>(FAILURE, <em>flip</em>, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (FAILURE, {}),</p>

<p>and for each rule of the following form that transitions to a letter-generating operation (where S and T are arbitrary states):</p>

<p>(S, <em>flip</em>, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (T, <em>newstack</em>),</p>

<p>add another state S&prime; (with a name that differs from all other states) and replace that rule with the following rules:</p>

<p>(S, <em>flip</em>, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (S&prime;, {<em>stacksymbol</em>}),<br/>
(S&prime;, HEADS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (T, <em>newstack</em>), and<br/>
(S&prime;, TAILS, <em>stacksymbol</em>) &rarr; (FAILURE, {}).</p>

<p>Then if the stack is empty upon reaching the FAILURE state, the result is 0, and if the stack is empty upon reaching any other state, the result is 1.  By Dughmi et al. (2021)[^67], the machine now simulates the distribution&#39;s probability generating function.  Moreover, the function is in class <strong>PDA</strong> by Theorem 1.2 of Mossel and Peres (2005)[^65] because the machine is a full-domain pushdown automaton.  &#x25a1;</p>

<p>Define a <em>stochastic context-free grammar</em> as follows.  The grammar consists of a finite set of <em>nonterminals</em> and a finite set of <em>letters</em>, and rewrites one nonterminal (the starting nonterminal) into a word.  The grammar has three kinds of rules (in generalized Chomsky Normal Form (Etessami and Yannakakis 2009)[^68]):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr; <em>a</em> (rewrite <em>X</em> to the letter <em>a</em>).</li>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr;<sub><em>p</em></sub> (<em>a</em>, <em>Y</em>) (with rational probability <em>p</em>, rewrite <em>X</em> to the letter <em>a</em> followed by the nonterminal <em>Y</em>).  For the same left-hand side, all the <em>p</em> must sum to 1.</li>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr; (<em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>) (rewrite <em>X</em> to the nonterminals <em>Y</em> and <em>Z</em> in that order).</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of a letter (such as <em>a</em>), a rule can use <em>&epsilon;</em> (the empty string). (The grammar is <em>context-free</em> because the left-hand side has only a single nonterminal, so that no context from the word is needed to parse it.)</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 5:</strong> <em>Every stochastic context-free grammar can be transformed into a pushdown automaton.  If the automaton is a full-domain pushdown automaton and the grammar has a one-letter alphabet, the automaton can generate words such that the length of each word follows the same distribution as the grammar, and that distribution&#39;s probability generating function is in class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof Sketch:</em> In the equivalent pushdown automaton:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr; <em>a</em> becomes the two rules&mdash;<br>(START, HEADS, <em>X</em>) &rarr; (<em>letter</em>, {}), and<br>(START, TAILS, <em>X</em>) &rarr; (<em>letter</em>, {}).<br>Here, <em>letter</em> is either START or a unique state in <em>F</em> that &quot;detours&quot; to a letter-generating operation for <em>a</em> and sets the state back to START when finished (see Proposition 4).  If <em>a</em> is <em>&epsilon;</em>, <em>letter</em> is START and no letter-generating operation is done.</li>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr;<sub><em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></sub> (<em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>Y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) (all rules with the same nonterminal <em>X</em>) are rewritten to enough rules to transition to a letter-generating operation for <em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, and swap the top stack symbol with <em>Y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, with probability <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, which is possible with just a finite-state machine (see Proposition 4) because all the probabilities are rational numbers (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^65].  If <em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is <em>&epsilon;</em>, no letter-generating operation is done.</li>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr; (<em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>) becomes the two rules&mdash;<br>(START, HEADS, <em>X</em>) &rarr; (START, {<em>Z</em>, <em>Y</em>}), and<br>(START, TAILS, <em>X</em>) &rarr; (START, {<em>Z</em>, <em>Y</em>}).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, <em>X</em> is the stack symbol EMPTY if <em>X</em> is the grammar&#39;s starting nonterminal. Now, assuming the automaton is full-domain, the rest of the result follows easily.   For a single-letter alphabet, the grammar corresponds to a system of polynomial equations, one for each rule in the grammar, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr; <em>a</em> becomes <em>X</em> = 1 if <em>a</em> is the empty string (<em>&epsilon;</em>), or <em>X</em> =  <em>&lambda;</em> otherwise.</li>
<li>For each nonterminal <em>X</em>, all <em>n</em> rules of the form <em>X</em> &rarr;<sub><em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></sub> (<em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>Y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) become the equation <em>X</em> = <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>*<em>&lambda;</em><sub>1</sub>*<em>Y</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>*<em>&lambda;</em><sub>2</sub>*<em>Y</em><sub>2</sub> + ... + <em>p</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>*<em>&lambda;</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>*<em>Y</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, where <em>&lambda;</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is either 1 if <em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is <em>&epsilon;</em>, or <em>&lambda;</em> otherwise.</li>
<li><em>X</em> &rarr; (<em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>) becomes <em>X</em> = <em>Y</em>*<em>Z</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solving this system for the grammar&#39;s starting nonterminal, and applying Proposition 4, leads to the <em>probability generating function</em> for the grammar&#39;s word distribution.  (See also Flajolet et al. 2010[^69], Icard 2020[^70].) &#x25a1;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The stochastic context-free grammar&mdash;<br><em>X</em> &rarr;<sub>1/2</sub> (<em>a</em>, <em>X1</em>),<br><em>X1</em> &rarr; (<em>X</em>, <em>X2</em>),<br><em>X2</em> &rarr; (<em>X</em>, <em>X</em>),<br><em>X</em> &rarr;<sub>1/2</sub> (<em>a</em>, <em>X3</em>),<br><em>X3</em> &rarr; <em>&epsilon;</em>,<br>which encodes ternary trees (Flajolet et al. 2010)[^69], corresponds to the equation <em>X</em> = (1/2) * <em>&lambda;</em>*<em>X</em>*<em>X</em>*<em>X</em> + (1/2)*<em>&lambda;</em>*1, and solving this equation for <em>X</em> leads to the probability generating function for such trees, which is a complicated expression.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>A stochastic context-free grammar in which all the probabilities are 1/2 is called a <em>binary stochastic grammar</em> (Flajolet et al. 2010)[^69].  If every probability is a multiple of 1/<em>n</em>, then the grammar can be called an &quot;<em>n</em>-ary stochastic grammar&quot;.  It is even possible for a nonterminal to have two rules of probability <em>&lambda;</em> and (1&minus; <em>&lambda;</em>), which are used when the input coin returns 1 (HEADS) or 0 (TAILS), respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>If a pushdown automaton simulates the function <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>), then <em>f</em> corresponds to a special system of equations, built as follows (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^65]; see also Esparza et al. (2004)[^71].  For each state of the automaton (call the state <em>en</em>), include the following equations in the system based on the automaton&#39;s transition rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>(<em>st</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>sy</em>) &rarr; (<em>s2</em>, {}) becomes either <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>st</em>,<em>sy</em>,<em>en</em></sub> = <em>p</em> if <em>s2</em> is <em>en</em>, or <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>st</em>,<em>sy</em>,<em>en</em></sub> = 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>(<em>st</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>sy</em>) &rarr; (<em>s2</em>, {<em>sy1</em>}) becomes <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>st</em>,<em>sy</em>,<em>en</em></sub> = <em>p</em> * <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>s2</em>,<em>sy1</em>,<em>en</em></sub>.</li>
<li>(<em>st</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>sy</em>) &rarr; (<em>s2</em>, {<em>sy1</em>, <em>sy2</em>}) becomes <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>st</em>,<em>sy</em>,<em>en</em></sub> = <em>p</em>*<em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>s2</em>,<em>sy2</em>,<em>&sigma;[1]</em></sub>*<em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>&sigma;[1]</em>,<em>sy1</em>,<em>en</em></sub> + ... + <em>p</em>*<em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>s2</em>,<em>sy2</em>,<em>&sigma;[n]</em></sub>*<em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>&sigma;[n]</em>,<em>sy1</em>,<em>en</em></sub>, where <em>&sigma;[i]</em> is one of the machine&#39;s <em>n</em> states.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Here, <em>p</em> is the probability of using the given transition rule; the special value HEADS becomes <em>&lambda;</em>, and the special value TAILS becomes 1&minus;<em>&lambda;</em>.)  Now, each time multiple equations have the same left-hand side, combine them into one equation with the same left-hand side, but with the sum of their right-hand sides.  Then, for every variable of the form <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>a</em>,<em>b</em>,<em>c</em></sub> not yet present in the system, include the equation <em>&alpha;</em><sub><em>a</em>,<em>b</em>,<em>c</em></sub> = 0.  Then, for each final state <em>fs</em> that returns 1, solve the system for the variable <em>&alpha;</em><sub>START,EMPTY,<em>fs</em></sub> (where START is the automaton&#39;s starting state) to get a solution (a function) that maps the open interval (0, 1) to itself. (Each solve can produce multiple solutions, but only one of them will map that open interval to itself assuming every <em>p</em> is either HEADS or TAILS.) Finally, add all the solutions to get <em>f</em>(<em>&lambda;</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Assume there is a pushdown automaton (<em>F</em>) that follows Definition 1 except it uses a set of <em>N</em> input letters (and not simply HEADS or TAILS), accepts an input word if the stack is empty, and rejects the word if the machine reaches a configuration without a transition rule.  Then a pushdown automaton in the full sense of Definition 1 (<em>G</em>) can be built.  In essence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a new FAILURE state, which when reached, pops all symbols from the stack.</li>
<li>For each pair (<em>state</em>, <em>stacksymbol</em>) for <em>F</em>, add a set of rules that generate one of the input letters (each letter <em>i</em> generated with probability <em>f</em><sub> <em>i</em></sub>(<em>&lambda;</em>), which must be a function in <strong>PDA</strong>), then use the generated letter to perform the transition stated in the corresponding rule for <em>F</em>.  If there is no such transition, transition to the FAILURE state instead.</li>
<li>When the stack is empty, output 0 if <em>G</em> is in the FAILURE state, or 1 otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then <em>G</em> returns 1 with the same probability as <em>F</em> accepts an input word with letters randomly generated as in the second step.  Also, one of the <em>N</em> letters can be a so-called &quot;end-of-string&quot; symbol, so that a pushdown automaton can be built that accepts &quot;empty strings&quot;; an example is Elder et al. (2015)[^72].</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proposition 6:</strong> <em>If a full-domain pushdown automaton can generate a distribution of words with the same letter, there is a full-domain pushdown automaton that can generate a distribution of such words conditioned on&mdash;</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>a finite set of word lengths, or</em></li>
<li><em>a periodic infinite set of word lengths.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>One example of a finite set of word lengths is {1, 3, 5, 6}, where only words of length 1, 3, 5, or 6 are allowed.  A <em>periodic infinite set</em> is defined by a finite set of integers such as {1}, as well as an integer modulus such as 2, so that in this example, all integers congruent to 1 modulo 2 (that is, all odd integers) are allowed word lengths and belong to the set.</p>

<p><em>Proof Sketch:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>As in Lemma 1A, assume that the automaton stops when it pops EMPTY from the stack.  Let <em>S</em> be the finite set (for example, {1, 3, 5, 6}), and let <em>M</em> be the maximum value in the finite set.  For each integer <em>i</em> in [0, <em>M</em>], make a copy of the automaton and append the integer <em>i</em> to the name of each of its states.  Combine the copies into a new automaton <em>F</em>, and let its start state be the start state for copy 0.  Now, whenever <em>F</em> generates a letter, instead of transitioning to the next state after the letter-generating operation (see Proposition 4), transition to the corresponding state for the next copy (for example, if the operation would transition to copy 2&#39;s version of &quot;XYZ&quot;, namely &quot;2_XYZ&quot;, transition to &quot;3_XYZ&quot; instead), or if the last copy is reached, transition to the last copy&#39;s FAILURE state.  If <em>F</em> would transition to a failure state corresponding to a copy not in <em>S</em> (for example, &quot;0_FAILURE&quot;, &quot;2_FAILURE&quot;, &quot;3_FAILURE&quot; in this example), first all symbols other than EMPTY are popped from the stack and then <em>F</em> transitions to its start state (this is a so-called &quot;rejection&quot; operation).  Now, all the final states (except FAILURE states) for the copies corresponding to the values in <em>S</em> (for example, copies 1, 3, 5, 6 in the example) are treated as returning 1, and all other states are treated as returning 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow (1), except as follows: (A) <em>M</em> is equal to the integer modulus minus 1.  (B) For the last copy of the automaton, instead of transitioning to the next state after the letter-generating operation (see Proposition 4), transition to the corresponding state for copy 0 of the automaton.  &#x25a1;</p></li>

<p><strong>Proposition 7:</strong> <em>Every constant function equal to a quadratic irrational number between 0 and 1 is in class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p>A <em>continued fraction</em> is one way to write a real number.  For purposes of the following proof, every real number greater than 0 and less than 1 has the following <em>continued fraction expansion</em>: 0 + 1 / (<em>a</em>[1] + 1 / (<em>a</em>[2] + 1 / (<em>a</em>[3] + ... ))), where each <em>a</em>[<em>i</em>], a <em>partial denominator</em>, is an integer greater than 0.  A <em>quadratic irrational number</em> is an irrational number that can be written as (<em>b</em>+sqrt(<em>c</em>))/<em>d</em>, where <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are rational numbers.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em>  By Lagrange&#39;s continued fraction theorem, every quadratic irrational number has a continued fraction expansion that is eventually periodic; the expansion can be described using a finite number of partial denominators, the last &quot;few&quot; of which repeat forever.  The following example describes a periodic continued fraction expansion: [0; 1, 2, (5, 4, 3)], which is the same as [0; 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, ...].  In this example, the partial denominators are the numbers after the semicolon; the size of the period (<code>(5, 4, 3)</code>) is 3; and the size of the non-period (<code>1, 2</code>) is 2.</p>

<p>Given a periodic expansion, and with the aid of an algorithm for simulating <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/bernoulli.html#Continued_Fractions"><strong>continued fractions</strong></a>, a recursive Markov chain for the expansion (Etessami and Yannakakis 2009)[^68] can be described as follows.  The chain&#39;s components are all built on the following template.  The template component has one entry E, one inner node N, one box, and two exits X0 and X1.  The box has one <em>call port</em> as well as two <em>return ports</em> B0 and B1.</p>

<li>From E: Go to N with probability <em>x</em>, or to the box&#39;s call port with probability 1 &minus; <em>x</em>.</li>
<li>From N: Go to X1 with probability <em>y</em>, or to X0 with probability 1 &minus; <em>y</em>.</li>
<li>From B0: Go to E with probability 1.</li>
<li>From B1: Go to X0 with probability 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let <em>p</em> be the period size, and let <em>n</em> be the non-period size.  Now the recursive Markov chain to be built has <em>n</em>+<em>p</em> components:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each <em>i</em> in [1, <em>n</em>+1], there is a component labeled <em>i</em>.  It is the same as the template component, except <em>x</em> = <em>a</em>[<em>i</em>]/(1 + <em>a</em>[<em>i</em>]), and <em>y</em> = 1/<em>a</em>[<em>i</em>].  The component&#39;s single box goes to the component labeled <em>i</em>+1, <em>except</em> that for component <em>n</em>+<em>p</em>, the component&#39;s single box goes to the component labeled <em>n</em>+1.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to Etessami and Yannakakis (2009)[^68], the recursive Markov chain can be translated to a pushdown automaton of the kind used in this section. Now all that&#39;s left is to argue that the recursive Markov chain terminates with probability 1.  For every component in the chain, it goes from its entry to its box with probability 1/2 or less (because each partial numerator must be 1 or greater).  Thus, the component recurses with no greater probability than not, and there are otherwise no probability-1 loops in each component, so the overall chain terminates with probability 1. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong> <em>The square root function sqrt(&lambda;) is in class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> See Mossel and Peres (2005)[^65]. &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 1:</strong> <em>The function f(&lambda;) = &lambda;<sup>m/(2<sup>n</sup>)</sup>, where n &ge; 1 is an integer and where m &ge; 1 is an integer, is in class <strong>PDA</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Start with the case <em>m</em>=1.  If <em>n</em> is 1, write <em>f</em> as sqrt(<em>&lambda;</em>); if <em>n</em> is 2, write <em>f</em> as (sqrt&#x2218;sqrt)(<em>&lambda;</em>); and for general <em>n</em>, write <em>f</em> as (sqrt&#x2218;sqrt&#x2218;...&#x2218;sqrt)(<em>&lambda;</em>), with <em>n</em> instances of sqrt.  Because this is a composition and sqrt can be simulated by a full-domain pushdown automaton, so can <em>f</em>.</p>

<p>For general <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>, write <em>f</em> as ((sqrt&#x2218;sqrt&#x2218;...&#x2218;sqrt)(<em>&lambda;</em>))<sup><em>m</em></sup>, with <em>n</em> instances of sqrt.  This involves doing <em>m</em> multiplications of sqrt&#x2218;sqrt&#x2218;...&#x2218;sqrt, and because this is an integer power of a function that can be simulated by a full-domain pushdown automaton, so can <em>f</em>.</p>

<p>Moreover, <em>f</em> is in class <strong>PDA</strong> by Theorem 1.2 of (Mossel and Peres 2005)[^65] because the machine is a full-domain pushdown automaton. &#x25a1;</p>

<h4>Finite-State and Pushdown Generators</h4>

<p>Another interesting class of machines (called <em>pushdown generators</em> here) are similar to pushdown automata (see above), with the following exceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each transition rule can also, optionally, output a base-<em>N</em> digit in its right-hand side.  An example is: (<em>state</em>, <em>flip</em>, <em>sy</em>) &rarr; (<em>digit</em>, <em>state2</em>, {<em>sy2</em>}).</li>
<li>The machine must output infinitely many digits if allowed to run forever.</li>
<li>Rules that would pop the last symbol from the stack are not allowed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The &quot;output&quot; of the machine is now a real number <em>X</em> in the form of the base-<em>N</em> digit expansion <code>0.dddddd...</code>, where <code>dddddd...</code> are the digits produced by the machine from left to right.  In the rest of this section:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>CDF(z)</code> is the cumulative distribution function of <em>X</em>, or the probability that <em>X</em> is <em>z</em> or less.</li>
<li><code>PDF(z)</code> is the probability density function of <em>X</em>, or the derivative of <code>CDF(z)</code>, or the relative probability of choosing a number &quot;close&quot; to <em>z</em> at random.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <em>finite-state generator</em> (Knuth and Yao 1976)[^61] is the special case where the probability of heads is 1/2, each digit is either 0 or 1, rules can&#39;t push stack symbols, and only one stack symbol is used.  Then if <code>PDF(z)</code> has infinitely many derivatives on the open interval (0, 1), it must be a polynomial with rational coefficients and satisfy <code>PDF(z) &gt; 0</code> whenever 0 &le; <code>z</code> &le; 1 is irrational (Vatan 2001)[^73], (Kindler and Romik 2004)[^74], and it can be shown that the expected value (mean or &quot;long-run average&quot;) of <em>X</em> must be a rational number. [^75]</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 8.</strong> <em>Suppose a finite-state generator can generate a probability distribution that takes on finitely many values.  Then:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Each value occurs with a rational probability.</em></li>
<li><em>Each value is either rational or transcendental.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>A real number is <em>transcendental</em> if it can&#39;t be a root of a nonzero polynomial with integer coefficients.  Thus, part 2 means, for example, that irrational, non-transcendental numbers such as 1/sqrt(2) and the golden ratio minus 1 can&#39;t be generated exactly.</p>

<p>Proving this proposition involves the following lemma, which shows that a finite-state generator is related to a machine with a one-way read-only input and a one-way write-only output:</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> <em>A finite-state generator can fit the model of a one-way transducer-like k-machine (as defined in Adamczewski et al. (2020)[^76] section 5.3), for some k equal to 2 or greater.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof Sketch:</em> There are two cases.</p>

<p>Case 1: If every transition rule of the generator outputs a digit, then <em>k</em> is the number of unique inputs among the generator&#39;s transition rules (usually, there are two unique inputs, namely HEADS and TAILS), and the model of a finite-state generator is modified as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <em>configuration</em> of the finite-state generator consists of its current state together with either the last coin flip result or, if the coin wasn&#39;t flipped yet, the empty string.</li>
<li>The <em>output function</em> takes a configuration described above and returns a digit.  If the coin wasn&#39;t flipped yet, the function returns an arbitrary digit (which is not used in proposition 4.6 of the Adamczewski paper).</li>
</ol>

<p>Case 2: If at least one transition rule does not output a digit, then the finite-state generator can be transformed to a machine where HEADS/TAILS is replaced with 50% probabilities, then transformed to an equivalent machine whose rules always output one or more digits, as claimed in Lemma 5.2 of Vatan (2001)[^73].  In case the resulting generator has rules that output more than one digit, additional states and rules can be added so that the generator&#39;s rules output only one digit as desired.  Now at this point the generator&#39;s probabilities will be rational numbers. Now transform the generator from probabilities to inputs of size <em>k</em>, where <em>k</em> is the product of those probabilities, by adding additional rules as desired.  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><em>Proof of Proposition 8:</em> Let <em>n</em> be an integer greater than 0. Take a finite-state generator that starts at state START and branches to one of <em>n</em> finite-state generators (sub-generators) with some probability, which must be rational because the overall generator is a finite-state machine (Icard 2020, Proposition 13)[^66].  The branching process outputs no digit, and part 3 of the proposition follows from Corollary 9 of Icard (2020)[^66].  The <em>n</em> sub-generators are special; each of them generates the binary expansion of a single real number in the closed unit interval with probability 1.</p>

<p>To prove part 2 of the proposition, translate an arbitrary finite-state generator to a machine described in Lemma 2.  Once that is done, all that must be shown is that there are two different non-empty sequences of coin flips that end up at the same configuration. This is easy using the pigeonhole principle, since the finite-state generator has a finite number of configurations. Thus, by propositions 5.11, 4.6, and AB of Adamczewski et al. (2020)[^76], the generator can generate a real number&#39;s binary expansion only if that number is rational or transcendental (see also Cobham (1968)[^77]; Adamczewski and Bugeaud (2007)[^78]).  &#x25a1;</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 9.</strong> <em>If the distribution function generated by a finite-state generator is continuous and algebraic on the open interval (0, 1), then that function is a piecewise polynomial function on that interval.</em></p>

<p>The proof follows from combining Kindler and Romik (2004, Theorem 2)[^74] and Knuth and Yao (1976)[^61] with Richman (2012)[^79], who proved that a continuous algebraic function on an open interval is piecewise analytic (&quot;analytic&quot; means writable as $c_0 x^0+ ... +c_i x^i + ...$ where $c_i$ are real numbers).</p>
